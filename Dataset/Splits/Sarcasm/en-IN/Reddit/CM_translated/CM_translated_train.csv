330,"Brijesh Kumar Mishra, the main accused in a high-profile immigration scam involving fake offer letters from Canadian colleges, has pleaded guilty to three counts and has been sentenced to three years in prison. Mishra, who was arrested by the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) on June 23, 2023, now faces approximately 19 months of imprisonment after accounting for time served, though he may be eligible for parole before completing the full term. Mishra, who operated a firm called M/S Education Migration Services, was charged with multiple offenses under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. These included unauthorized representation, counseling misrepresentation, and aiding individuals to misrepresent or withhold material facts. The scam, which came to light in March 2023, affected hundreds of Indian students, primarily from Punjab, who were facing deportation from Canada after discovering that their offer letters were fake. According to the CBSA, Mishra, who hails from Darbhanga in Bihar, was apprehended at an airport in British Columbia while attempting to enter Canada later years The charges laid against him stemmed from a comprehensive criminal investigation that revealed he had been offering immigration advice without a proper license and had been inducing clients to misrepresent information to Canadian authorities. The court proceedings detailed Mishra's actions between January 1, 2016, and February 12, 2020, during which he knowingly advised individuals in connection with immigration applications under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. His illegal activities were contrary to Section 91(1) of the Act and resulted in significant distress for many students and their families. On March 17, 2023, Jalandhar police registered a case against Brijesh Kumar Mishra and his partners under sections 465, 467, 468, 471, and 120B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The investigation was later transferred to the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit. Additionally, the Jalandhar district authorities revoked the license of his consultancy. Mishra charged an average of Rs 16 lakh from each student for visa-related services and college admissions. Upon the students' arrival in Canada, Mishra would inform them that seats were unavailable at the colleges listed in the offer letters. He would then advise them to either seek admission at other colleges or wait for the next intake. In some instances, he returned the college fees, but in many cases, he did not.",0,True

I am a PSB a banker and have worked in forex in another PSB for 6 years and one of the big issues we face in such of these remittances is that the payment is often stuck with intermediatory bank for various reasons . One of the major reason being the purpose of remittance is not clearly mentioned by the remitter. So intermediatory bank just keep them in their account and after some time simply return it to the sender.
So my suggestion is first obtain the swift copy from your remitter and then contact the Forex SBI Branch that deals with inward remittances and help them to sort it out.
While it's the responsibility of your base Branch to sort it out , the reality is most staffs in banks have zero understanding of froex and forex related transactions. So better to contact that forex Branch and ask them to track the payment from their **swift module** using your swift copy.
Then it will be easy to track the payment and give credit to your account.

For example you can see construction cranes and material conveyor belt like things being used by bigger companies because that gives them cost optimisation and they're able to compete with other modernized players
Whereas if you go to smaller towns or to people who do smaller scale work, they still use old methods.
Why?
1 The new methods needs a lot of skills, time and patience to reach a level of competency required for giving the customer the same set of deliverables as they do now.
2 Financial incentive: It is often a large captial expense required to make the switch for smaller setups who may not have credit access. And since the demand for that kind of work doesn't reward extra for  it being done by any modern method , there's no incentive.
3 Risk taking ability. Every new migration comes with challenges. So for example if you want a small store owner to begin to track his inventory and make sales  using a cloud solution they won't be ready to face an outage or the prospect of paying more for security or similar upgrades because it doesn't add that much value compared to the cost

Government has no business in doing business. Highways are not like telephone plans or insurance. Don't think they can just be privatised the same way. Building highways is not a business for the government. It is an expenditure on infrastructure. 
They could turn it into a profitable business and start selling monthly subscriptions and family plans for people to drive on the highways instead of setting up toll booths only at district borders or such.

Russia is also friends with China, and china also own a few variants of sukhoi's, even the variants of su-30(su-30mki is the backbone of Indian Air force). Infact Chinese jets are half stolen US reverse engineered tech and the rest is Russian. 2. Rafale's are in a league of their own, a few years ago French forces, claimed to have won a dogfight with F-22 Raptor in a friendly exercise. 3. Russian jet engines are not as good as western counterparts. Although they are faster, they are a lot bulkier, bigger and have substantially more downtimes/maintenance times than western jets and their engines. 4. Russian engines on an average last only 4000hrs while American ones last about 10-12k hours. (Not sure about rafale) 5. Rafal's are just a lot more reliable have better avionics etc. it makes sense 6. Rafal's are launched by catapult whereas Russian aircrafts by ski jump. (Catapult is considered to be superior). 7.

1160,"OP. Here is my take on this. As any other person on this subreddit, you can choose to ignore this and go off on a tangent.
The problem about Hindu vs Muslims, is not one about religions. It is not about cultural practices either. It is nevermore so about the wrongs done by one community on other. The problem is, however, about isolation.
Think about your parents. How many Muslims on average do they interact with in a normal and very casual setting, say every day? Or let's say every week? Every month? Every year? In last 10 years of their lives?
The answer you will find is very few. There is very little exposure today. While the world is connected more so than ever, the exposure has decreased. So where do they get their exposure to form opinions about others? From media. And I am not talking about News media. I am talking about the entire media in general. Be it songs, movies, shows, art, literature, etc. Anyone who is forming their opinions, either in positive light or in negative light, they are doing so by exposing the themselves to these media.
Now, why is media so polarising? Is it because of politics? Well, that has always been true to a partial extent. Then is it because of apathy? That is essentially an outcome, isn't it? So it can't be that.
The answer to above will be the need for comfort. Majority population in every nation, in every era, in every region, has always been on a struggle to survive. In times past, the working hours were less, but the living conditions weren't so much. In times of current era, the living conditions have improved exponentially, but so have working hours and need for labour. All this leaves a common populace devoid of energy to look outside of what they find comfortable, be it in terms of opinions and thought process or in terms of experiences. And this is why they turn to media.
We have seen examples, countless many, that illustrate that people who are exposed to a widers variety of opinions and cultures are able to empathise more easily with others and be a tad bit more understanding.
But this exposure requires you to ensure you get exposed to both wrongs and rights of an idea or a culture. Simply being content with one side of a community or ideal will always make you blind to the other side and hamper a full understanding of why someone may stand on the opposite end of the empathy spectrum with respect to the idea or culture you support or stand against.
And all of this is individual effort. It is no one else's responsibility to ensure you are exposed to every facet of an idea or culture. No moral responsibility or ethical responsibility, lies on others to improve your understanding. You yourself are the sole heir of that responsibility. Others may sometimes come as a guide or helpers to point you in a direction.
So both you and your parents have yet to fully understand the ideas and cultures you support and/or stand against.",0,False

Every religion is flawed and barbaric and people defend it. Christianity is based on human sacrifice. And hinduism has gems like the caste system and sati.

An ideology cannot grow if it does not try to grow. All religions either do this or go extinct. That's how a religion works. Christians have missionaries that do the exact same thing. Hinduism does the same except it assimilates any and everything into hinduism. You worship a fish, that's fine, you worship a cow, that's fine, you eat fish and cow, that's fine too. That's the modern hinduism. Animal sacrifice is an essential part of Bengali Hindu culture, which would be unimaginable to a rajasthani veg Hindu.

1450,"OP:
Do you think that the times have remained unchanged? Society has evolved significantly, and it is essential to reconsider the focus of gender-centric schemes. These initiatives should now be targeted towards the specific sections of society that truly need them, rather than being broadly applied. This is because those who are already privileged often benefit the most, while those in genuine need remain underserved.
Recognizing the changing dynamics of our society is crucial. To ensure fairness and effectiveness, it is important to adapt our policies and programs to reflect the current realities. By focusing resources on those who truly need assistance, we can work towards achieving greater equity and inclusiveness. Additionally, continuous assessment and adjustment of these schemes can help address the evolving challenges faced by different sections of society.
I believe society has progressed to a stage where gender is no longer the primary ground for discrimination. Instead, financial capacity has become the more significant factor. A girl from a wealthy family is given all the opportunities, while a person from a poor family faces discrimination regardless of gender. 
While there are always exceptions, this trend generally holds true. 
It's important to recognize that socio-economic status plays a crucial role in determining access to opportunities. 
Therefore, policies and programs should focus more on bridging the financial gap to ensure that all individuals, regardless of their gender, have equal opportunities to succeed. 
By addressing economic disparities, we can work towards a more equitable society where everyone has the chance to thrive.",0,False

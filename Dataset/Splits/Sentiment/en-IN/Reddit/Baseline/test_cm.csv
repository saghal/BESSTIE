Since my belief is that as long as you are alive you have potential and as long as you have potential, you are valued, loved and cherished as a human being. If by nobody else, then at least by me. I would love to hear what happens next in your story.

65,"I think you are confusing an Israeli based ""private"" firm selling its targeted political campaigning services with an Israeli govt agency working only for themselves.

Israel has several ""private"" companies offering targeted services for/against high value targets, which are deployed even by several foreign government agencies/clients.
Pegasus by NSO, Cambridge Analytica started by those EX-Israeli special forces etc. were used by all kinds of clients across the political spectrum. Some cross the line at some point, and then they get shut down, and a new one takes its place. For example, Cambridge Analytica came down tumbling by interfering in US elections, but they were doing very well when they were doing the same thing all over the world before that.
These ""private"" companies work for anyone who pays them well, and as long as they are useful in the long run for Israel/US, they seem to be allowed to operate with certain freedom on what they do, and who they target on a smaller scale. They might have a leash, but they also have a bit of room to play around, improve their techniques, and make money.

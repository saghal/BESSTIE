Even a non Ivy League college there is miles better than top nits and govt medical colleges for technical education and medical studies. 
The biggest factor is ease of getting into us colleges as compared to indian ones due to population. 
If she wants to get into pure sciences the situation is even worse. A bachelor in science in top colleges like delhi university amounts to shit(telling from experience) compared to us. 
And lastly high school. I have some friends who did their high schooling in the us. They can vouch that the quality of high school life there is a lot better. In India hardly anyone comes to school in 11th and 12th standards in science stream as all are going coaching for competitive exams for most part of the day. It breaks kids.

"I think you are confusing an Israeli based ""private"" firm selling its targeted political campaigning services with an Israeli govt agency working only for themselves.

Israel has several ""private"" companies offering targeted services for/against high value targets, which are deployed even by several foreign government agencies/clients.
Pegasus by NSO, Cambridge Analytica started by those EX-Israeli special forces etc. were used by all kinds of clients across the political spectrum. Some cross the line at some point, and then they get shut down, and a new one takes its place.

These ""private"" companies work for anyone who pays them well, and as long as they are useful in the long run for Israel/US, they seem to be allowed to operate with certain freedom on what they do, and who they target on a smaller scale.

No. They should follow the order of the govt. If we elect bad people, that's on us. Army is not there to uphold constitution.

Army getting more power will lead to a lot more human rights violations and if the govt interferes to stop that, army will say NO to the cabinet.",0,0,True,en-IN,Reddit

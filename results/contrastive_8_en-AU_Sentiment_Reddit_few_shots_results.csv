"I have no doubt that libs will chart housing starts and show their time in office where they grew to levels never seen during covid then showing under labor that they have reduced. Ie building volumes are reducing under labor. At the same time as massive population growth.
The reasons for the collapse are higher costs of construction and liberals new home grant at the tail end of their time in office but labor have done nothing material to change this. 
Ie we are starting less homes when we have a government that tells us they are addressing supply. 
So labor talk about supply more than liberals but the results are shit. Maybe not their fault but they certainly could do things that address this. Things they are not doing. 
Sure they can promise after their first term they will eventually reach their 1.2million homes but this will fall flat when for the entirity of their term demand has exceeded supply and rents have spiked.

Hey dude. You can find the GenCost report here: 
At the topic of page 32, the first sentence on the page, it says this:

While we recognise the likely occurrence of a FOAK premium, where possible, GenCost does not include them for other technologies not yet deployed in Australia and so does not intend to do so for largescale nuclear. South Korea was identified as the best representation of a continuous building program.

He's had science roles since then, one at the university, and now at a pathology lab. Pay is pretty bad though - just under $70K for working night shifts.

"AAT senior member Chris Furnell said the man's case was finely balanced between protecting the Australian community against other considerations including his ties to Australia. Mr Furnell ultimately opted to cancel the revocation of the man's visa.
The fallout from Direction 99 comes amid ongoing scrutiny of Mr Giles and the Albanese government's handling of the 152 people released from indefinite detention following a High Court decision late last year. Several of those individuals have since been arrested on fresh offences.
Opposition immigration spokesman Dan Tehan said it was clear that Direction 99 was having an impact on community safety.
""Andrew Giles needs to explain why he won't change this direction and why he won't change it immediately,"" Mr Tehan said.
""What this clearly shows is that your ties to Australia are given primacy over everything else. No matter how Andrew Giles tries to spin it, he is endangering the Australian community through the changes he made. Once again, this is a complete mess of the minister's own making.""
Mr Giles said this week he was seeking urgent advice in relation to Saki, and criticised the AAT's decision to reinstate Saki's visa as ""inconsistent"" with Direction 99.
Asked on Friday about the number of visa reinstatements that had relied on Direction 99, a spokesman for Mr Giles said the direction placed a ""significant emphasis on serious offending and family violence  which need to be considered in all matters"".",0,0,True,en-AU,Reddit

The seat boundaries are about as ugly as the name. It's a hodgepodge of the eastern suburbs of Perth and adjacent wheatbelt areas.

"I am surprised to see this from Ed Husic. It isn't the transformational tax changes that many have been calling for of late, but it's good to see this get raised by the ALP as it'll probably be the first properly bipartisan policy in a while if they are serious about it. 
Our Company Income Tax rate is higher than the average rate in all regions (with the average in our region being 19.8%) and if we are truly concerned with productivity, this is where we start. 
But, whilst the highest marginal tax rate is 45%, a reduction in the corporate rate encourages further tax rate arbitrage, particularly in personal services income fields. 
Had we proceeded with S3TC as we should have, lowering the top rates and pushing 30% out to 2x average would have removed this incentive totally and would have allowed us to lower company tax rates to attract investment and unlock productivity.

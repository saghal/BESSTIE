"Having had burgers and fries in various continents and brands such as McDonalds, Shake Shack, 5Guys, CaliBurger, Triple O and Burger King, I have to say this branch even though smaller, has minimal seats cooks a good burger and especially proper potatoe fries freshly made unlike a competitor with golden arches that consistently serves soggy, warm, over salted, processed fries. You can learn a lot from Burger King with properly cooked meals golden arches. Also the scented palm oil that golden arches are known use really smells and impacts food negatively especially when the food temperature drops and gets cold as palm oil is solid at room temperature. As with many mainstream burger chains and franchises I find the burgers not served up to 71c cooking temperature. Its always warm and there seems, in the UK no Food and Safety, like the US to require cooking and serving your burger hot at Burger King seriously fix your app. Heck contact me and I'll work with you on it.",0,1,False,en-UK,Google

"I had a disappointing experience at the restaurant last night When I went to order at the counter, the staff told me to use the self-service kiosks instead. While I understand they are promoting this new technology, the young blonde woman came across as rude in her approach. I did n't receive a paper receipt at the end. After waiting 10 minutes to receive my food, I noticed concerning practices like staff picking their nose while preparing food! Keeping food warm in the fry station. Multiple staff members had untidy uniforms with only one wearing an apron, which made me wonder about the general hygiene standards. While most of the staff seemed totally lost, only two employees who stood out in a positive way and knew what they were doing I do n't know their names but the tall man with glasses who was out the back and the female employee bagging orders at the fry station.

"mainly due to the "" loaded fries "" I say that loosely. The main reason for Nandoes was to try the loaded fries, and was just mega disappointed. But I'll get to that at the end. Sunset Burger: Absolutely lovely, and tasty. Around on its own I believe, and then instead of going for the sides we opted for the loaded fries as another dish instead. The burger as a stand alone item would be. Loaded fries: Do n't get fooled by advertisement. It was 8, and I tasted 5 too much. Firstly the loaded element, which was hard to find any chicken it claimed to have in, I think I counted around 3 strands. And then alot of the loaded, is very central, so you feel there is no flavour else where. The main issue is the flavour / taste, the only way to describe it, is it tasted like the old mini oven pizzas I used to have when I was younger. The taste was identical to that pizza, which was so odd to have that cheap oven pizza taste on chips. It did n't have any unique flavours, or any spice. We had to drown it in hot sauce, to then get Hot Oven Pizza flavour. Honestly I would n't recommend it at all, it's not worth disappointing yourself for 8.

"Went on a whim and ordered here despite my previous abysmal experience with Pizza Hut in Hayes. I was pleasantly surprised. The first thing I noticed was the pizza had not been overcooked. The crust golden, like it had been soaking in the rays on a picturesque Caribbean beach. Perfectly moist and spongy as one would expect. Secondly, the cheese was there. Usually I am second guessing myself, wondering if I had accidentally clicked the' Extra Dough' option when ordering, rather than extra cheese. This time it had visibly slid across the surface of the pizza in transit due to the sheer weight and consistency-something that I wo n't deduct points for. Anyway, having a few slices with a bit less cheese, knowing you are going to reach those absolutely coated came as quite an exciting and almost tense ordeal. The sauce was plenty ladled, and because the pizza was n't overcooked, the toppings were juicy and tender. Remember, if we want pepperoni crisps we will just buy them from the shop. I guess this time the person preparing the pizza is a connoisseur themselves; or they just care about their customers. All in all, great experience.",0,1,False,en-UK,Google

There was a great crunch from the veg, the sauce was spicy, numbing and a little funky which was delicious. Kept having more! Etles spicy trotters: the sauce on this is truly exceptional, I personally love the texture of trotters so I really enjoyed this dish, maybe something for the more adventurous eaters as my friend did n't like the texture( but still loved the sauce).

The second waitress was a little too eager to take our order; we had only just started looking through the menu, but was happy to wait. We eventually settled on the choc chip cookie dough with salted caramel ice cream( of which there is a vast choice of flavours), a strawberry gelato milkshake, and the Brookie. We were also given a taster plate of 4 macarons. These were far less favourable than our order. The waitress was n't sure of the flavours, but we guessed at 2 x coffee, which we did nt try as we dislike coffee, 1 x pistachio, which did nt taste of anything, and 1 x strawberry, which was quite nondescript, just sweet. As they were complimentary it did nt matter much but if we had paid for a box of them, we would be disappointed, from what we tried.

"If you're in the mood for a culinary adventure, look no further than Starfish. Nestled alongside a picturesque riverside patio, this gem of a bistro offers an exquisite selection of seafood and wood-fired pizza that will leave your taste buds dancing with delight. The standout for me was the delectable Thai Chicken Pizza. The harmonious blend of zesty Thai flavors with succulent chicken and perfectly baked crust was nothing short of a taste revelation. It's a bold fusion that pays off in spades-a must-try for any pizza enthusiast. Equally impressive were the Curly Fries. Golden and crispy on the outside, with just the right amount of seasoning, they were a delightful accompaniment to our meal. These fries elevated the experience, adding an extra layer of satisfaction.",1,1,True,en-AU,Google

"Positives: First time going to this place today. Let me tell you, coming from a family of chefs this was delectable, the dine in meals came out fast, they were LARGE portions, and very good temperature. We ordered the flowered onion( fried and whole), we ordered the Louisiana chook both entrees. Then I had the parmigiana as my main with mash and veg. The mash and veg was perfectly cooked, though the mash tastes a little like packet mash. The sauce with the Louisiana chicken is a little spicy so if you ca n't tolerate a little spice the sauce is n't for you. But man oh man the crunch on the chook and the juicy chicken was incredible, was thoroughly enjoyable. The parmigiana was LARGE so much so I could n't finish it all. Great that they gave takeaways Negatives: The drink I ordered was the summer one in the mocktails section, tasted great only issue I really had was the lemon seeds in the drink, lucky the straws were n't big enough to suck them up otherwise we would had an issue trying to fish multiple seeds out of the drink. We loved the Louisiana chicken so much we ordered some to take away, sadly to our disappointment the portion sizes were very different, much smaller and not as crunchy still very tasty and very juicy just not the same portion sizes as dine in( specifically regarding our dining experience) We also ordered take away chocolate churro and fruit fondu. The Churros are Exquisite as far as crunch goes but there is little to no cinnamon sugar on it. But the lack of cinnamon sugar can be covered up by the chocolate sauce and fruit eaten together bite by bite. The sauce also tasted Store bought which is still tasted good to me but may not be to everyone liking. The flowered onion, leaves much to be desired for, I definitely would n't eat it by itself as it essentially just a whole onion fried up. The sauce was nice and it goes well with the main meal. Other: I must say they brought the mains out not long after we got our entrees which is okay. Just did n't really get time to savour the entrees. The serves seems a little all over the place but generally very welcoming and accomodating. Also Incase anyone wants to know they have the MCCS discounts( for marines) Over all my dining experience was fantastic. Just a little disappointed with the takeaway serving sizes. And the wait for takeaway was MUCH longer than the wait for the main meal. Taste for those specific meals( besides the onion and the lack of cinnamon sugar) was great. Will definitely bring my husband and other family here again:",1,1,True,en-AU,Google

We had the table right at the entrance, which was not a great place at all and there was no other attention to the birthday. Why do you promote this and yet 0 is implemented ?

My partner ordered the steak medium rare and got a steak well done... in a steak restaurant you expect that the cooking levels should n't be a problem and that they know their way around.

Then his food arrived( when I had almost finished eating) and the meat was only cooked medium. absolute disappointment Dessert: when we got the dessert menu we had to wait over 20 minutes to be able to order.

"Second time ordering from this place. I was happy with my first order so thought why not try their butter chicken which is something I usually order from other restaurants. Sauce and bread were good but there were only 5 small bite sized pieces of chicken. I payed 27 dollars( Uber, excl service / delivery) for this dish and it quite disappointing. Feels like I bought sauce and bread, not chicken. Called the owner to make sure it was n't a mistake. Was told 5 small pieces off the skewer was the standard. I shared feedback and said customers would probably be more happy with a bit more chicken and said many other restaurants serve a decent amount to which he said other restaurants are serving you the fat cuts off the chicken & that he does n't make his money from butter chicken anyway. If you not making money from butter chicken and do n't want to serve it properly then it time to remove it from the menu. Also, pretty sure I can tell the difference between fat trimmings and a piece of breast / thigh. You have people who would love to support you. It would be great if you were more open to customer feedback. After looking at the reviews I can see there are many who had this issue. 27 for mostly sauce and bread is not good enough. Wo nt be back as there are other places more generous with the serving. All the best.",0,0,True,en-AU,Google
This place used to do amazing Afghan naan. But now the quality and weight of naan has dropped. Naan has got smaller and middle of the naan is like paper with burns. This business is not operating in an ethical way since they have two lines for naan. One line of one pack and another line for more than one pack. Which is ridiculous cos line for more than one pack gets stagnant while one pack line moves since they serve only that line. They need to adopt a number serving system soon I think. Lot of fighting happening there during weekends. Hope the owners think about a better way soon before the council or police intervenes for a pack of naan,0,0,True,en-AU,Google

Really great selection of baked goods! The Bischoff cheesecake was delicious-the texture of the pastry was great. We tried some pies and sausage rolls too and the pastry was beautiful-golden and flaky. Staff were friendly. Will come back and try more things!,1,1,True,en-AU,Google
"Ate here for lunch before a talk. Quick, convenient, efficient. Chose a tomato and lemon ricotta open sandwich which staff offered to add a second slice of bread and toast it. Did n't mention there'd be an additional 1 charge, but I expected that but would have preferred to be informed up front. Drinks were OK, and the brownie I had for dessert was quite tasty. Paperplate is n't as fancy as it's older brother' bookplate' upstairs, but I'll be eating here again for the quicker service.",1,1,True,en-AU,Google
We drove especially to visit a Cold Rock ice creamy and were not disappointed. The lady serving was very efficient and also friendly. The business has a great selection and a very large selection of add on. The chocolate add on were all quality and this added to the whole experience. Due to stupid restrictions we could not taste test We also could not sit inside but we're free to sit in the mall mixing with far more people.,1,1,True,en-AU,Google

"UPDATE: The food has really gone downhill over the last few months. Has there been a change in management ? We come regularly and have noticed it's gone from lovely fresh food to pre-cooked cafeteria style. Dry eggs and leathery bacon were obviously pre-ocoked and from a bain marie-if not, they were overcooked either way! Coffee is still good and the donuts, too But, generally the food has been not good. Very disappointing.",0,0,True,en-AU,Google
"Overall it's a nice restaurant for the area. The prices were a bit high, but the dishes were pretty good quality( in most cases, see below) Service was quite nice, no complaints there. Started with a very terrible kaarage chicken. The pieces of chicken were burnt and it was expensive( 9) Next waited over 30 min for a chirasi don, it was n't very busy. The chirasi don was fresh and tasted great, clearly the highlight. Finally had a shrimp roll. It was pretty good, but had a bit too much mayo for my tastes. This is just a preference thing. I'd be excited to try this place again!",1,1,True,en-AU,Google

"We visited Griffith in early Jan so a lot of restaurants were closed. Happy that this one was open as we really enjoyed our meal. Service was attentive and helpful. We had a couple of jumbo pizzas, salad and chips which was plenty for the 5 of us. Good that they do half half pizzas too so we could try a wider range. Kids had Margherita and Hawaiian, adults had a couple of the veggie pizza toppings. Thin and crispy style with not too much toppings and cheese, which is how we prefer our pizzas. Big servings and reasonable prices. Would definitely recommend this place although I know there are many other pizza options in the area which we have not tried.",1,1,True,en-AU,Google

"An institution on Hardware Lane specialising in Hanoiese-style Vietmanese pho boasting all natural ingredients, no MSG and a broth recipe that has remained unchanged for over 45yrs. Northern-Vietnamese pho is very different to their Southern counterparts-and I believe this place is as authentic as you'll get in the CBD. Both dishes had a rich and flavorful broth, perfectly cooked noodles, and a balance of fresh herbs and condiments. There are no bean sprouts because there are n't supposed to be bean sprouts.. that's a Southern thing! Northern pho is not complicated and has no frills. Be your own pilot and decide but in my opinion, Pho Thin nails it in the simplicity and for it to be MSG free makes it a clear broth winner! My only qualm is that the donut was n't the best one I've had-it needed to be crispier and not as dense.. And maybe a bigger serving for the size of the bowl of pho. Definitely order one per bowl.. it's not a sharing serving size at all!",1,1,True,en-AU,Google
Had a great experience here. Saturday is a set banquet of 7 courses which made it easy if you eat all things and are n't allergic to anything. Had no idea what to expect( as friend booked it) and was pleasantly impressed. We were so full by serving 5 could hardly move but each dish was carefully crafted and next to no wait time. All food was so fresh and really delicious. I would definitely recommend and try again. Fave was the XO snapper.. so great. The restaurant styling was also on point. Nice one team a great spot promoting Orange,1,1,True,en-AU,Google

"My visit to Rocksalt was great. The staff were friendly, the restaurant felt cosy and had enough space between tables to give the impression you had some privacy. The Pork Belly I had was cooked to perfection. The crackling crunched and the meat underneath it had n't dried out, and everything retained its flavour. The mash that accompanied the pork was smooth and went well with the gravy that came with the dish. The veg did its job too. If you want the full menu make sure you get an inside table.",1,1,True,en-AU,Google
"I'm a regular diner. The Cooks in the kitchen are amazing. Most succulent chicken in the main Street of Airlie and being an Australian Steak House, Steaks are also amazing. We go for the food not the service. Unfortunately the customer service has n't been great the past few years since the new owners, as you can see from following reviews but I wanted to shout out to the new Australian lady that just started working last week. People like herself is what's going to turn this venue around and for the better. Thank you Tayla for your continuous customer service, you make our experience worth while now. We will be back for your service young lady. Keep it up.",1,1,True,en-AU,Google
Good sized servings. Cheap and cheerful. Chicken dumplings were juicy and the super tasty peppered calamari crunch was retained as they cut a corner off the lid. Definitely get the calamari if you come here. It really good.,1,1,True,en-AU,Google
I had an unfortunate experience at Kerry Korner Shop. I bought a roll on sunscreen on the shelf for 16. At the checkout I was charged. The extra was the eftpos fee. Now eftpos fees shoud be 1 to 2 % max. This was a fee of 8 %! I know it is illegal to charge an eftpos fee in excess of the real cost of using eftpos and this seems to be a sneaky way to charge the customer more without them realising and doing the math. The two stars are for the pleasant staff who took my money.,0,0,True,en-AU,Google

The person serving could have had a smile and been a bit more polite the food is a little expensive. But it's OK for a small cinema just a shame we could not enjoy the movie as kids were running up and down and making noise threw out the movie. Parents did nothing just sat there when spoke to the person in charge they just had a look and they did nothing so wasted money. Hoping next time our expirance will be better.,0,0,True,en-AU,Google

"This is one of the many restaurants spruiking for business along popular Hardware Lane with great character and ambience. We were enthusiastically greeted and seated on a busy Saturday afternoon. The menu had all the expected Italian favourites, and pizzas looked to be the most popular choice. We tried a pizza and risotto dish, both of which were very enjoyable. It was very busy and looked popular with both tourists and locals. We decided to try the desserts because everyone wants to know if the tiramisu is any good, right ? Well, it was good, as was the gooey lava cake. All said, an enjoyable meal.",1,1,True,en-AU,Google

There is some beautiful peices and should be worth a look.",1,1,True,en-AU,Google

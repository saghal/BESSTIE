"If you're in the mood for a culinary adventure, look no further than Starfish. Nestled alongside a picturesque riverside patio, this gem of a bistro offers an exquisite selection of seafood and wood-fired pizza that will leave your taste buds dancing with delight. The standout for me was the delectable Thai Chicken Pizza. The harmonious blend of zesty Thai flavors with succulent chicken and perfectly baked crust was nothing short of a taste revelation. It's a bold fusion that pays off in spades-a must-try for any pizza enthusiast. Equally impressive were the Curly Fries. Golden and crispy on the outside, with just the right amount of seasoning, they were a delightful accompaniment to our meal. These fries elevated the experience, adding an extra layer of satisfaction.",1,en-AU,Google,Sentiment

"Positives: First time going to this place today. Let me tell you, coming from a family of chefs this was delectable, the dine in meals came out fast, they were LARGE portions, and very good temperature. We ordered the flowered onion( fried and whole), we ordered the Louisiana chook both entrees. Then I had the parmigiana as my main with mash and veg. The mash and veg was perfectly cooked, though the mash tastes a little like packet mash. The sauce with the Louisiana chicken is a little spicy so if you ca n't tolerate a little spice the sauce is n't for you. But man oh man the crunch on the chook and the juicy chicken was incredible, was thoroughly enjoyable. The parmigiana was LARGE so much so I could n't finish it all. Great that they gave takeaways Negatives: The drink I ordered was the summer one in the mocktails section, tasted great only issue I really had was the lemon seeds in the drink, lucky the straws were n't big enough to suck them up otherwise we would had an issue trying to fish multiple seeds out of the drink. We loved the Louisiana chicken so much we ordered some to take away, sadly to our disappointment the portion sizes were very different, much smaller and not as crunchy still very tasty and very juicy just not the same portion sizes as dine in( specifically regarding our dining experience) We also ordered take away chocolate churro and fruit fondu. The Churros are Exquisite as far as crunch goes but there is little to no cinnamon sugar on it. But the lack of cinnamon sugar can be covered up by the chocolate sauce and fruit eaten together bite by bite. The sauce also tasted Store bought which is still tasted good to me but may not be to everyone liking. The flowered onion, leaves much to be desired for, I definitely would n't eat it by itself as it essentially just a whole onion fried up. The sauce was nice and it goes well with the main meal. Other: I must say they brought the mains out not long after we got our entrees which is okay. Just did n't really get time to savour the entrees. The serves seems a little all over the place but generally very welcoming and accomodating. Also Incase anyone wants to know they have the MCCS discounts( for marines) Over all my dining experience was fantastic. Just a little disappointed with the takeaway serving sizes. And the wait for takeaway was MUCH longer than the wait for the main meal. Taste for those specific meals( besides the onion and the lack of cinnamon sugar) was great. Will definitely bring my husband and other family here again:",1,en-AU,Google,Sentiment

"I reserved a table and made a special note when booking that it was for a birthday. They also advertise that you get a great seat and free chocolate etc. None of this was realized at all. We had the table right at the entrance, which was not a great place at all and there was no other attention to the birthday. Why do you promote this and yet 0 is implemented ? When the food arrived, we were disappointed once again. My partner ordered the steak medium rare and got a steak well done... in a steak restaurant you expect that the cooking levels should n't be a problem and that they know their way around. He had to give the meat back and I had to eat it once because otherwise it got cold. Great to celebrate a birthday in the restaurant and I ca n't even eat with my partner at the same time. Then his food arrived( when I had almost finished eating) and the meat was only cooked medium. absolute disappointment Dessert: when we got the dessert menu we had to wait over 20 minutes to be able to order.

"Second time ordering from this place. I was happy with my first order so thought why not try their butter chicken which is something I usually order from other restaurants. Sauce and bread were good but there were only 5 small bite sized pieces of chicken. I payed 27 dollars( Uber, excl service / delivery) for this dish and it quite disappointing. Feels like I bought sauce and bread, not chicken. Called the owner to make sure it was n't a mistake. Was told 5 small pieces off the skewer was the standard. I shared feedback and said customers would probably be more happy with a bit more chicken and said many other restaurants serve a decent amount to which he said other restaurants are serving you the fat cuts off the chicken & that he does n't make his money from butter chicken anyway. If you not making money from butter chicken and do n't want to serve it properly then it time to remove it from the menu. Also, pretty sure I can tell the difference between fat trimmings and a piece of breast / thigh. You have people who would love to support you. It would be great if you were more open to customer feedback. After looking at the reviews I can see there are many who had this issue. 27 for mostly sauce and bread is not good enough. Wo nt be back as there are other places more generous with the serving. All the best.",0,en-AU,Google,Sentiment
This place used to do amazing Afghan naan. But now the quality and weight of naan has dropped. Naan has got smaller and middle of the naan is like paper with burns. This business is not operating in an ethical way since they have two lines for naan. One line of one pack and another line for more than one pack. Which is ridiculous cos line for more than one pack gets stagnant while one pack line moves since they serve only that line. They need to adopt a number serving system soon I think. Lot of fighting happening there during weekends. Hope the owners think about a better way soon before the council or police intervenes for a pack of naan,0,en-AU,Google,Sentiment

"An institution on Hardware Lane specialising in Hanoiese-style Vietmanese pho boasting all natural ingredients, no MSG and a broth recipe that has remained unchanged for over 45yrs. Northern-Vietnamese pho is very different to their Southern counterparts-and I believe this place is as authentic as you'll get in the CBD. Both dishes had a rich and flavorful broth, perfectly cooked noodles, and a balance of fresh herbs and condiments. There are no bean sprouts because there are n't supposed to be bean sprouts.. that's a Southern thing! Northern pho is not complicated and has no frills. Be your own pilot and decide but in my opinion, Pho Thin nails it in the simplicity and for it to be MSG free makes it a clear broth winner! My only qualm is that the donut was n't the best one I've had-it needed to be crispier and not as dense.. And maybe a bigger serving for the size of the bowl of pho.

"I have no doubt that libs will chart housing starts and show their time in office where they grew to levels never seen during covid then showing under labor that they have reduced. Ie building volumes are reducing under labor. At the same time as massive population growth.
The reasons for the collapse are higher costs of construction and liberals new home grant at the tail end of their time in office but labor have done nothing material to change this. 
Ie we are starting less homes when we have a government that tells us they are addressing supply. 
So labor talk about supply more than liberals but the results are shit. Maybe not their fault but they certainly could do things that address this. Things they are not doing. 
Sure they can promise after their first term they will eventually reach their 1.2million homes but this will fall flat when for the entirity of their term demand has exceeded supply and rents have spiked.

Brunswick East is good too, a bit quieter and closer to Merri Creek parkland. Pretty much anywhere between Brunswick and Footscray would be a good choice, places like Ascot Vale, Moonee Ponds, Kensington, North Melbourne etc.   
Keep in mind that all of these places are dense and right next to each other so I wouldn't say there are any real major differences.

"Ex-chef here I very rarely tip these days as I don't go out anywhere near as much as I did and it's only in exceptional circumstances that I will. 
It doesn't matter what type of place it is, either. 
It could be a shitty little el cheapo breakfast place that serves bacon, eggs, and grilled tomato with supermarket white toast, that has been halved into triangles to fill the Kmart plates it's served on and the server, waiter or whatever is the perfect example of what hospitality service should be I've been known to leave a $20 under the dirty plate and leaving before they clear the table, being sure to say thanks to them for breakfast on my way out. Make me feel like I'm a part of your local community, or an old friend not just a customer.
I've worked in kitchens at some reasonably top shelf places, and have never recieved any cut of the tips. Depending on the clientele, it wasn't unusual for $2k in tips to be left. Which would only ever go straight into the waiter's pocket. Apparently, only the service was good and the food must have been shit I don't tip in those places. I'm already paying out the arse for the meals and drinks, and I'm not overly fond of  adding to what is probably already a decent pot for the evening. 
I more likely to approach the pass and thank the chefs, slide a $50 for a round of after work drinks to one of them, while ensuring a couple of the others know as well. Chefs can be dodgy as fuck!

The fallout from Direction 99 comes amid ongoing scrutiny of Mr Giles and the Albanese government's handling of the 152 people released from indefinite detention following a High Court decision late last year. Several of those individuals have since been arrested on fresh offences.
Opposition immigration spokesman Dan Tehan said it was clear that Direction 99 was having an impact on community safety.
""Andrew Giles needs to explain why he won't change this direction and why he won't change it immediately,"" Mr Tehan said.
""What this clearly shows is that your ties to Australia are given primacy over everything else. No matter how Andrew Giles tries to spin it, he is endangering the Australian community through the changes he made. Once again, this is a complete mess of the minister's own making.""

Our Company Income Tax rate is higher than the average rate in all regions (with the average in our region being 19.8%) and if we are truly concerned with productivity, this is where we start. 
But, whilst the highest marginal tax rate is 45%, a reduction in the corporate rate encourages further tax rate arbitrage, particularly in personal services income fields.

We did n't plan to be there much so it was perfect place to shower and sleep. Service was welcoming when we checked in but did n't have any other interaction with any staff the rest of our time there. Only thing we would recommend they sort out is the door to access the rooms on top of the hotel-every time it's opened it slams shut loudly.",0,en-AU,Google,Sarcasm
The staff are lovely & the food is pretty consistent. I just wish the ao could be more accurate about delivery times. There needs to be some sort of warning on super busy nights so when you select the location you get a warning that tells you that your wait will be longer than usual due to them being busy. This way you could decide if you want to wait or if you will go somewhere else.,0,en-AU,Google,Sarcasm
"Ordered a Mini Value range pizza for collection. Staff were happy to' custom make "" it without a couple of ingredients, as I requested. When I entered the store the staff ignored me for about 5 minutes, plus their usual customer-facing screen that shows yr order & what stage it's at was offline, so I had no idea if it was made or not. Eventually, after serving another collecting customer( & not speaking to or looking at me before or during that interaction) they' found' my order, which had been sitting on a warming plate for the whole time I waited. If they were so short staffed they had to make pizzas rather than serve, a simple' sorry we'll be right with you' wld have gone a long way, instead of making me feel like I was invisible. Luckily, the pizza was delicious.",1,en-AU,Google,Sarcasm
"I was in Cairns for the Anzac Day long weekend. I attended for a late lunch and ordered fish and chips. The fish and salad were excellent, but the chips were well below par. I was born in the UK, and if I order fish and chips, I expect man chips, not farting little overdone French fries. The French fries were offered on the plate in a tiny, pathetic cardboard boat. Not enough!! The presentation was ok, but I left the restaurant wanting to find a traditional seaside fish and chippy that sold authentic chips. The fish was nice. Sorry but this is only my opinion. Others may not agree.",0,en-AU,Google,Sarcasm

Just visit Again , sushi still as good as how it was. but the hot snack was really disappointed. the mushroom i can only taste the taste of the oil. it make me feel. the vege croquette and the squid stick is taste like full of flour.

This place used to do amazing Afghan naan. But now the quality and weight of naan has dropped. Naan has got smaller and middle of the naan is like paper with burns. This business is not operating in an ethical way since they have two lines for naan. One line of one pack and another line for more than one pack. Which is ridiculous cos line for more than one pack gets stagnant while one pack line moves since they serve only that line. They need to adopt a number serving system soon I think. Lot of fighting happening there during weekends. Hope the owners think about a better way soon before the council or police intervenes for a pack of naan,1,en-AU,Google,Sarcasm
"The staff here are a real standout! They're friendly and hospitable. The atmosphere is cosy. Both the drink and food menu have a great variety. There is a large selection of desserts, all of which have been delicious when I've tried them. The tiramasu is especially good. And you must n't leave without the almond cookies. The food is presented very well, and the portions are perfect. We have tried a variety of dishes over the years. The prawn and caesar salad are particularly good. The pork options have been nice, too. The pizza toppings are great, and there are heaps of flavours. It would be even better if they were woodfire!

Been to this place several times. Heaps of room with even area for a party hall. Their service is good and quick. Wait time is less.

"We recently stayed at the Adina and I have to say we were thoroughly disappointed with the room we were allocated. The hotel was fully booked and I feel as though the room we were given should n't of been offered to guests. It smelled like dank, musty cigarette which we could still smell on our clothes in our suitcases when we got home, there was visible dust on the TV cabinet, and on the first night, our air conditioner did n't work. The next morning the Manager( who was quick to respond to our request) came up to our room to inspect and kicked the unit to get it working again. At least it worked. Not only was the hotel in bad shape, but the city too. There is a TAB just downstairs from the accommodation which attracts the wrong types of people. My son( age 7) dodged a bicycle being thrown in his direction from one of the TAB patrons who was yelling and swearing at another patron, they were about to get into a physical altercation. We crossed the road very quickly! We felt very unsafe. The city is housing many who are doing it tough and sleeping rough and on my morning walk, all I could smell was human urine.

"This Korean barbecue restaurant holds sentimental value for me as it was the first place I dined out upon arriving in Brisbane several years ago. While I've noticed a slight decline in food quality since then, the experience is still worth revisiting.

Nevertheless, the vibrant atmosphere and unique dining experience make it a worthwhile visit.",0,en-AU,Google,Sarcasm
Why did I wait so long before checking this place out. It was fantastic. The building has been modernised as best as possible for accessibility and there are a few art stations where kids can have a break and contribute.

"It takes 1.6 units of electrical energy to produce 1 unit of hydrogen energy. That's simple chemistry and it can't be changed anymore than you can change the fact that if you set fire to wood you will get hear and light. But then you have to spend more energy refrigerating the hydrogen, and it's so cold it embrittles the pipes etc which have to be frequently replaced, it leaks and so on.
In the Space Shuttle programme, only 55% of the liquid hydrogen was actually burned in the rocket engines - the rest was lost in transit, evapourated in storage and so on. 12.6% was lost simply transferring it from a tanker truck to a storage tank.
So then you are in effect spending 1.6 x 1/0.55 = 2.91 units of energy to get 1 unit of useful hydrogen. Of course, we might suppose that we are going to be more efficient and effective than an agency which has half a century of experience handling liquid hydrogen and has spent billions of dollars trying to make it more efficient and effective, but this seems unlikely.
This only works if we have some massive surplus of renewable electricity which we have no other use for, so that we don't care that most of it is wasted in the process. Given that fossil fuels are still being used for about 2/3rds of the country's electricity, this seems unlikely to happen in the near future.

">The attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, said the reform would protect any Victorian who made a report to police, granting them complete immunity if their alleged perpetrator tries to bring a defamation suit against them.
Allegations usually result in the person alleged having their freedom compromised very quickly through being detained or bailed, regardless if they are actually innocent. As we have seen in other recent developments of making bail harder to obtain, the net result of allegation is effectively punishing a person in advance of determining their guilt by using the justice system process against them.
Once in the justice system, mud sticks even if the alleged criminal is proven not guilty. Until recently, innocent people could better protect themself against the effects of false allegation by taking defamation action, but this new legislation appears to block that avenue, meaning the justice system would now effectively be protecting people making false allegations.
I acknowledge the issue of people being fearful of coming forward to report crimes, however a balance needs to be struck here against the ability to punish people through mere allegation, which may also be false, in advance of a judgement of guilt.
The proposed legislation appears to effectively grant accusers immunity from false allegations.
In our system of justice, the costs of making allegations is borne by the state, however the cost of defense, including defending their reputation, against allegations is usually borne by the defendant. Part of this defense is the ability to raise defamation action against false accusation. Without that option, the defendant is subject to public slander and loss of freedom as punishments in advance of even proof of guilt, based merely on allegation. Even if proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt fails, the defendant is not compensated for the loss of public standing and the punishment already meted out by the justice system in advance of the verdict.
Whilst I understand the court has some leeway to punish an accuser for false allegations, this is not prescribed.
Justice is supposed to be for both accused and accuser, but we are increasingly seeing justice be applied in favour of the accuser, allowing false or unfounded accusations to punish the accused, regardless of the outcome of the court.
Crimes need to be objective harms of import, because our system of justice already punishes people based on allegation only, regardless of their guilt, which stretches the integrity of justice and the presumption of innocence. To also punish people, regardless of their guilt, as revenge for subjective hurt feelings would be outrageous, however many crimes are just that, based on subjective hurt feelings and not objective harms.
I urge the justice system not to keep lowering the threshold to criminal activity, so that false accusations can more easily be used to punish innocent people regardless of the court judgement.
I think society has lost focus of the principle of justice to more easily allow the revenge punishment of innocent people for subjective hurt feelings and for advantage. We have to find a better method of progressing justice that honours both the accused and accuser equally along with the presumption of innocence.
If a crime is of sufficient import and true, then it is worthwhile pursuing and if that is still having a chilling effect on coming forward, then we need to address why that is, not develop knee-jerk legislation to make it easier to punish people through using the justice system itself on unfounded or false allegation as revenge for subjective feelings.
>This perception that victim-survivors will be sued for speaking up can sometimes become a reality when they are threatened with defamation suits.
If an allegation is truthful, why would a defamation action succeed? Making a threat is pointless and has no power if it can't be carried out: that is where reason comes into the equation instead of capitulating to fear and paranoia.
However, I recognise that defamation law has severe limitations and I believe it needs to be re-evaluated along with the judicial process to return to the fundamental principles of justice.",0,en-AU,Reddit,Sarcasm

Which would only ever go straight into the waiter's pocket. Apparently, only the service was good and the food must have been shit I don't tip in those places. I'm already paying out the arse for the meals and drinks, and I'm not overly fond of  adding to what is probably already a decent pot for the evening. 
I more likely to approach the pass and thank the chefs, slide a $50 for a round of after work drinks to one of them, while ensuring a couple of the others know as well. Chefs can be dodgy as fuck!

"The Australian Federal Police union is threatening strike action to ""shut down"" airports and the sitting of federal parliament in a severe escalation of its dispute with the Albanese government over pay and conditions.  
AFP Association president Alex Caruana said the union had sought legal advice about whether AFP officers could legally walk out at airports and when parliament was sitting, saying members were sick of being ""disrespected"" by government. ""(We are considering) walking out at airports, walking out at Parliament House, walking out from other commonwealth assets and essentially shutting them down in order to make a point to the government and the AFP that we are serious about fighting for our pay and conditions and we want a fair pay deal,"" he told The Australian.  
Denouncing the government's latest pay offer of 11.2 per cent, Mr Caruana said he had spoken to about 1000 AFPA members in recent days and ""it's very clear they are very willing to vote yes to that action"".  
""Essentially, it would be that airports might have to shut down, parliament would have to stop sitting and certain other assets might have to come up with other arrangements,"" he said, identifying the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation and the Holsworthy Barracks as other potential locations for industrial action. ""It is a severe escalation but our members are sick of being disrespected by the government and by the AFP, and they want a fair pay deal. They don't want to be the lowest paid police force in Australia.""  
The AFPA is urging members to vote no to the AFP pay offer, which includes increases to allowances on top of 11.2 per cent in wage rises over three years.
If the offer is rejected, Mr Caruana said the union would examine applying to the Fair Work Commission for a protected action ballot order to authorise more significant industrial action. ""It's difficult for the AFP to do any strike action, or withholding of labour action, because of the implications to national security,"" he said. ""What I can say is that we are engaging some lawyers to look at what our options are in that space. ""We would consider that if we were to withdraw some labour from the airports, and we were to withdraw labour from places like Parliament House, from places like ANTSO and a few other places like Holsworthy etc, we're not actually putting the community at risk. ""If the airports continue to operate, the airports are then taking on that risk. If parliament chooses to sit, the parliament is then taking that risk but we are currently getting legal advice as to whether or not under the AFP Act, that would be in breach of national security and a step too far. We will consider any measures necessary to get the point across to government and the AFP that they need to offer a fair wage deal for AFP members.""",0,en-AU,Reddit,Sarcasm

"I've got friends from the US,  Canada and France that also commented on how prevalent it was here. 
I'm 40 and have never had a full time job. ( Well technically I have but it was month to month contracts and anyone who took a day off for any reason didn't have their contacts renewed.) 
I've been in my current job for 8 years and got denied permanency based on the fact that my shifts are irregular, and the annoying thing is the union rep agreed. Like I worked 2583 hours last financial year but because it wasn't 8 hrs a day 6 days a week, every week I don't get permanent.
Also as someone whose been casual for a while, other things have changed, like how long before a shift begins that they are scheduling something , places are literally getting calls from clients and saying yeah we can do that today for you, then ringing around staff to see whose available. It's shifting the risk/cost of business from the employer to the employee.
The law hasn't caught up with technology, I've talked to people who did my job more than 30 years ago, casual wasn't a thing because most people didn't have mobile phones, so they paid people to be on call, they don't anymore because everyone has a mobile so if I don't answer they'll try someone else and eventually someone will pickup and agree to come in. I've brought that up with the union and again they don't care.
 I want at a minimum what a friend in the US told me that they were proposing in his state ( can't remember if it went through) they were proposing a minimum notice period for temps ( what they call casuals) of 72hrs. A shift had to be scheduled with a person assigned to it at least 72 hours in advance. The only exception was if  someone called in sick. The Idea was to make businesses go back to putting people on call.",0,en-AU,Reddit,Sarcasm

"This is an old post I've shamelessly copied and pasted that explains why this belief is bullshit 
Australian ecologist here: my god, there is a lot of rubbish being touted in this thread.
Okay, first up: there are not more dangerous animals in Australia then elsewhere. This is a misconception fueled by silliness and exoticism. The famous list of Australia having nearly all of the world's most venomous snakes comes from a terrible LD50 study that only used five or so overseas snakes for comparison. To get a more accurate impression of relative venom toxicity, check out Dr Bryan Greig Fry's LD50 page.
For the question of why we have so many venomous snakes here to begin with, one has to look at the dispersal of snakes within Australia. First there was the best snakes of all (fact), the Aspidites-- primitive snakes that branched off the snake family before pythons evolved. Australia was pretty empty with just these guys around, so when the elapids came down from Asia, there was lots of space for them to diversify into. Elapids are very venomous snakes with fixed front fangs: cobras, mamba, etc. All venomous snakes in Australia are descended from these elapids.
Australia has pretty venomous snakes because they all came from highly venomous stock. Since elapids were the main game in town for so long, they diversified to take over all niches, from super-venomous (which get a lot of attention) to nearly lacking venom all together (which no-one pays much attention to!). So Australia has a diverse range of venomous snakes, not just highly venomous ones. Focusing on the big hitters and making ridiculous guesses as to why they're here is missing the bigger picture.
The very venomous sea snakes that we have are simply land elapids that diversified into the oceans.
Our spiders are not more venomous that those of anywhere else in the world. We haven't had a spider-bite fatality since the'50s, and even then it was children and the elderly that succumbed.
South America and Africa have many more venomous species than Australia, including more venomous lizards and venomous mammals (!).

"The ALP have been playing games with energy policy since the Rudd years, they're just using it as a wedge for social democracy, the goal has always been to destabilise the LNP in wealthy inner-city seats. Listen to what they got away at the last election, they ""won the argument"" by convincing the gullible public that all you had to do was vote for one party over another in order to have more cheap green energy, at no cost to anyone (that includes taxpayers and consumers) and they did this without providing any real policy detail or proper costings. If anyone dared to question this false argument, they were labelled either a ""denier"" of climate change or were subject to ridicule for not understanding the benefits of renewable energy. 
These arguments are extremely clever, at the end of the day, the ALP is a ruthless political machine, and Bowen and co and experienced and professional politicians. They skillfully framed the ""climate change"" debate as a political argument, and they won that argument comprehensively. Yet here we are, 2 years down the track and facing the prospect of blackouts, you can't make this stuff up.",1,en-AU,Reddit,Sarcasm

"Hordes of people, a wall like rack lined with packets of bread, that's the way to spot Madhuram Sandwich. Situated diagonally opposite to the famous Kaanch mandir, this small shop is Indore hidden gem for sandwich lovers. It sells unexpectedly good. Generously layered with Paneer cubes, capsicum, onion, cucumber and some tandoori mayo, these sandwiches are huge. It would n't be wrong to call it a huge club sandwich. Served with coriander chutney, ketchup and potato wafers, the sandwich is liberally topped with sev, jeeravan, mayo and cheese. The perfect combination for Indori taste buds. In short, a plate of sandwich can easily suffice two. Trust me, it's true. For me, even finishing three pieces of the sandwich was difficult. So if you plan on having this sandwich, make sure you have ample space in your tummy and do n't plan to order anything else, because you wo n't be able to eat anything after the sandwich. With just 5 bench tables to sit on and 3-4 tiny tables to stand and eat, the shop offers a decent space to accommodate the customers. A lot of people opt for take away and you can do so if you do n't like sitting on the street side to eat. The best part, this enormous sandwich is priced at Rs 150 only and reaches you in just 10 mins. Is n't it wow! Light on your pocket and light on the wait time as well. Check out Madhuram Sandwich when you crave for a great sandwich the next time and sink in this delicious street delicacy. Enjoy!",1,en-IN,Google,Sentiment

Even a non Ivy League college there is miles better than top nits and govt medical colleges for technical education and medical studies. 
The biggest factor is ease of getting into us colleges as compared to indian ones due to population. 
If she wants to get into pure sciences the situation is even worse. A bachelor in science in top colleges like delhi university amounts to shit(telling from experience) compared to us. 
And lastly high school. I have some friends who did their high schooling in the us. They can vouch that the quality of high school life there is a lot better. In India hardly anyone comes to school in 11th and 12th standards in science stream as all are going coaching for competitive exams for most part of the day. It breaks kids.

We have a problem where our domestic industry is not investing enough. Foreigners are. Atmanirbhar kaisey baneinge? The domestic industry is claiming that there is low capacity utilisation and other systemic issues leading to poor investments domestically.

"I think you are confusing an Israeli based ""private"" firm selling its targeted political campaigning services with an Israeli govt agency working only for themselves. The former is not limited to just Israel for their clients, or certain type of clients. Hence, the weird combination of their clientele.
Israel has several ""private"" companies offering targeted services for/against high value targets, which are deployed even by several foreign government agencies/clients.
Pegasus by NSO, Cambridge Analytica started by those EX-Israeli special forces etc. were used by all kinds of clients across the political spectrum. Some cross the line at some point, and then they get shut down, and a new one takes its place. For example, Cambridge Analytica came down tumbling by interfering in US elections, but they were doing very well when they were doing the same thing all over the world before that.
These ""private"" companies work for anyone who pays them well, and as long as they are useful in the long run for Israel/US, they seem to be allowed to operate with certain freedom on what they do, and who they target on a smaller scale. They might have a leash, but they also have a bit of room to play around, improve their techniques, and make money.

"I am editing the review after an year, in these have went to the restaurant for 15 to 20 times and ordered through swiggy. Recently, am facing worst experiences from the restaurant and some the things that I observed are: 1. Chicken biryani is not that par in taste and quality wise compared to the price. 2. Chicken lollipops are worst. I got leftover food delivered to me which I ordered through swiggy, chicken was hard to chew and dry. Also, have tasted nalli gosh biryani which is awesome in taste. I can see that the quality is decreasing over the time. We have ordered: mutton hot & sour soup( Rs 145), tandoori half plate( Rs 250), mutton dum biryani( Rs 350). 1. Mutton soup was a bit spicy. Really well. 2. Tandoori was awesome, best tandoori in. Chirala. No resturant in chirala provide Mayo( dawat, kanaka Durga) but they provide. Green chutney was superb. 3. Mutton dum biryani, mouth watering, biryani is soo good and mutton was perfectly cooked and juicy. Must try items: tandoori and mutton dum biryani.

It's in Thane.) we face this issue but coming up with the name of the cafe itself is something different. I liked their interiors it gives a perfect feel where how one waits in long traffics with traffic signal sign and stuff. Also their table is made like a road kinda thing something so unique. They've got some props and also a zebra coloured scooter for photobooth. For all you photogenic people do n't miss to get your selfies and come up with different poses. Coming to what I had here. 1. Flavoured Margarita: I liked this moctail which I felt it had the taste of the strawberry. It was really refreshing. 2. Go slow Indiana Pizza: This pizza had sauted bell peppers, onions, sundried tomatoes and cottage cheese. It really tasted well. The pizza base too was good. Must have. I had been here for a random visit like very very long back but will try something more next time and update my review.",0,en-IN,Google,Sarcasm
"If you want to experience korean food in Barrackpore then you must visit this cafe. The Decor is superb. The seating space is limited and generally packed during weekends. Visit early to get suitable seating space. Perfect place for Anime lovers, Korean drama fans and Harry Potter fans. You get amazing books Collection. You can also buy korean merch from there in house store. Food is AVERAGE. 1 SOJU is non alcoholic. Also you ca n't take away the bottle( Rs.) if you can not finish it. Tastes like appy fizz mixed with Sprite. 2 the Ramen is n't authentic. They use Maggie which is served with deep fried egg and chicken. It's not a korean noodles. The price point is high. Korean fried wings are good. You can give it a try. 3 beverage like-Vietnamese coffee, dalgona coffee, boba tea, is really good. 4 desserts are also worth trying. Overall a good cafe if you are visiting with your date.... but the price point is extremely high for the experience they offer.",0,en-IN,Google,Sarcasm

No. They should follow the order of the govt. If we elect bad people, that's on us. Army is not there to uphold constitution.

Rajnath Singh does not take decisions on his own will. He talks to these people and then takes the decision.

"My father was a government employee. He hated polling duties. Only very high ranking officials get good facilities. Although he was generally exempt from polling duties due to his job profile. 
One time, when he was a high ranking official, he was attached as zonal coordinator for Election Observer. He was provided an AC Cab, an armed Escort and contact info for all District election officers ( DM) in the region. He left home two days before the election with the Observer, travelling through remote polling booths making sure fair elections are being held. Calling police forces were needed, diffusing tense situations and returned home in the evening after the elections were done. 
He was accommodated in good hotels and guest houses, circuit houses, private guest houses of industries though he had hardly any time to eat or sleep. On the election eve, he got a call from a presiding officer of a booth about a broken machine. He went to the room of the DM of the district who was staying in the same guest house. DM opened the door, while talking on the phone on his shoulder while feeding the baby with a bottle. 
Some people will be like, so what if government employees have to work hard for a few days, most people work hard everyday. That's true, the only difference is that in case of election duty, every mistake is a fireable offense with jail time. And it's so easy to make mistakes when you have no idea what you are doing.  
You forgot to paint the finger for a voter? Jailed.

Most had safer option of spaghetti bolognese and while you got a big bowl full, it was alot of spaghetti and not enough sauce which was pretty standard in flavour and we did n't think was worth nearly 15 same price as the pizza its alot and both were inconsistent in size as you can see in pics with one far smaller than the other. I tried a new dish off the new signature beef and chianti ragu. Looked amazing online with the description. Pasta tasted lovely, good presentation and filling however again was was missing the cheese topping and tasted good but after a few mouthfuls I was not tasting the flavours I expected but was similar to the bolognese sauce. 3 people had desserts, 2 melting puddings and 1 brownie sundae which had nice presentation again roughly 7.

"Well McDonalds Food is always tasty. I think the electronic ordering stations inside the store are a great idea, but I think you need to add another one more atleast to make it run more efficiently especially at lunchtimes, and other busy times, because when people have a short time to get food within their break times from work, it can be very frustrating.

It was a busy lunchtime on a Wednesday afternoon. The person who served me did n't know that my meal came with a drink. The person who served my meal just put it down in front of me and walked off. Service was n't friendly but the food came fairly quickly. I sat outside. Unfortunately, the nicer seats out in the sun are for smokers and non-smokers have to sit in the shade.

We sat towards the back in the middle, so viewing angles were great. The negative, though, were the seats, which were a little uncomfortable, especially as it got toward the end of the film. Because of this, I've removed a star. Overall, I'd recommend coming here, and we will be heading back for sure.",1,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

We complained then the meal got served along with the second drink after we said we were leaving. The wait was n't great, no one explained anything until we complained. After we finished eating the very bland food, we waited another 15 minutes before our tables got cleared. This was after the waiter passed our table several times without paying any attention to us. We had already ordered dessert along with the main meal  but we still had to wait again after our main dishes had been cleared to even get that. Not sure I ever be back after this encounter that has left me feeling annoyed by everything( the service & the food). Not great at all because I had lost all my appetite by the time dessert was served.",0,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

I always used to have their vegetarian breakfast wraps, but I had to stop ordering them because they started looking like someone had thrown the wrap around the kitchen before making it. Plus they do n't melt the cheese and because its like a slice of cheddar when you bite into it its a weird sensation, you get all the hot from the hash browns etc then you reach this cold mush. It is n't great. However, I have now found the sausage muffins, and they are beautiful. For less than 5 I can get a quorn muffin, with an unlimited hot drink and hash brown!

The flavors and quality of the food continue to be a commendable aspect, providing a satisfying culinary experience.

A packed and vibrant atmosphere with attentive & friendly staff clearly please couples, groups of friends and family patrons.

I went with a friend as she had a couple of free tickets and I was gobsmacked at how run down it has become. The floors were dirty and fraying all over the place. The cafe now closed so the 10 % off food is now the junk they serve at the popcorn and pop counter. I used to enjoy a decent coffee upstairs with a bite to eat and my discount. The cafe is closed and the seating area is old worn out and so uninspiring. It's not worth the membership price any longer I am afraid to say. The Art house in Crouch end offers a better deal now with a lovely cafe and amazing membership prices. My friend has now joined the Art house cinema and has not renewed her Picture House one. It's a shame because it used to be a beautiful place to go I have added this last paragraph a couple of days later after reading most of the reviews.

The ambience of the restaurant transports you straight to the heart of Kerala with its warm, inviting decor and traditional music that sets the perfect mood for a culinary adventure.

Space at our table was very tight( there were eight of us) especially during our meal but that is n't a deal breaker for me as they were utilising space as they could on a busy night. The entertainment was reminiscent of a cabaret at an all-inclusive holiday hotel and a Haven caravan site. It was loosely themed on Moulin Rouge tonight and was heavily audience participative. The night ended with half of the punters doing the locomotion around the place and then dancing next to their tables. The overall experience was certainly not what I was expecting and in all fairness was n't really my sort of thing, but it was certainly' an experience' and a lot of the people in tonight seemed to love it. Prices of food and drink were a bit higher than other places and a ticket was required( just under 20).

"This place is very busy & popular. Went there on a Sunday morning at about had to wait 25 mins for a table so had a coffee in the front. I got a table outside in a nice courtyard. Slow service but they were very busy. The food well, I would say it got a non theme. I had the Big Kiwi breakfast as I wanted as close to quality tasty traditional / Irish breakfast as I could get here. The bacon was streaky. I prefer back bacon as I do n't want loads of fat. The sausage lacked taste. They had ciabatta which was very hard on the edges. Would have preferred some quality bread toasted but that just my preference. It probably just not the place for me. Perhaps too traditional on breakfasts but this place will be great for the non traditionalists.",1,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

"Unfortunate Birthday at Nando: Seeking a laid-back atmosphere for my New Year Eve birthday while I was feeling unwell, Nando seemed like the perfect choice  until our dinner plans turned into disappointment. The news of running out of whole chicken extended our wait to 30-40 minutes. Hoping to salvage the evening, we ordered chicken livers as a starter, priced at a hefty 9. To our surprise, it arrived as a small bowl with a single bread roll, and an extra roll set us back another quid! As a proud Portuguese, I can whip up a pot at a fraction of the cost. The seemingly dry reheated livers and stale extra roll only added insult to injury. To compound matters, our meal was slightly undercooked when it arrived, necessitating a return to the grill. By the time we finally sat down to eat at 9 pm, an hour later, the restaurant was closing, leaving us no choice but to take our meal away. The saving grace ? The staff friendliness. Nando, charging a premium for mediocre dishes, wo n't cut it. What is happening to British hospitality ? Portions and quality are decreasing, yet prices are rising!",0,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

I decided to go for the Butchers Brunch with poached eggs, treacle-cured pork belly chop, two Cumberland sausages, smoked back bacon, house rostis, chorizo beans, buttered toasted sourdough and my husband had 6 American Pancakes with streaky bacon, blueberries and maple syrup. Everything was very tasty, all the pork products on my brunch were well cooked without being dry the pancakes were nice and fluffy. The Butches Brunch was a bit pork-heavy for my liking and could have used something to lighten it a little, perhaps grilled tomato or mushrooms to cut through all the meat and the pancakes could have the option of some yoghurt to enhance them, none the less we enjoyed our lunch very much and want to return for breakfasts or dinner soon.

"This cinema has to be one of the cheapest cinemas around! Less than 6 per person, even when booking our tickets online. My husband and I went at the end of March.

Anyone who does n't like being in a lift much will probably not like this one, as it is also rather small. Sadly, most of the cinema decor looks old and rather shabby, though the seats in the smaller cinema are quite comfortable and despite my disability I managed a 2hr screening without too much discomfort or fidgeting, which is good for me.

We had a baby with us so we parked up outside and called it in, we get somewhat the same from our local Chinese which are common items so that's fine. 20 min wait which is great, especially since there was a steady stream of customers, always a few cars parked waiting. The price was good maybe slightly higher than our local but within the ball range. The special fired rice was great and so was the gravy and the missus loved hers. But we always get a portion of salt and pepper chips and me being a fatty chicken, I think it was strips. Sadly the range brings it down. Feels more like an after thought than a proper dish. It was fine though. A great take out overall and well priced. The smell did n't let me down and still makes me straving when I go past.",1,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

Had a Lamb Shish with rice but it was without asking served with a bowl of side salad, bulgar wheat, fresh pitta bread and the chilli sauce tasted splendid. The lamb was cooked to perfection and each piece tasted as tender, juicy and succulent as the last. The rice was the perfect accompaniment to this dish( as opposed to just the pitta or chips) it was ' warming ' and had a gentle, buttery taste. Interior was simple, yet beautiful; a modern and classic mixed look. There even a veiled prayer booth / section at the back; now you may not pray( or be of the Islamic faith) but the addition of such a room was thoughtful-and it blended in and added to the whole ambience.

"Chikaros, nestled in the heart of West Bromwich offers a tantalizing fusion of flavors that cater to diverse palates. During my recent visit, I embarked on a culinary journey that left me both satisfied and impressed. Upon entering the cozy ambiance of Chikaros, I was greeted by the aroma of spices and the welcoming smiles of the staff. The menu, boasting an array of enticing options, immediately caught my attention. From traditional classics to innovative creations, there was something to please every taste bud. I opted for the Chef Kebabish, a delightful combination of succulent meats grilled to perfection and infused with aromatic spices. Each bite was a symphony of flavors, showcasing the culinary expertise of the chefs. The tender meat paired beautifully with the accompanying sauces, creating a harmonious blend of sweet and savory notes. Equally impressive was the Classic Parmesan, a timeless favorite elevated to new heights at Chikaros. The crispy coating gave way to a tender chicken breast, smothered in rich marinara sauce and gooey melted cheese. It was a comforting indulgence that left me craving more. However, despite the culinary delights, I was disappointed to discover that Chikaros does not accept card payments. While this may not deter cash-carrying patrons, it poses an inconvenience for those accustomed to the convenience of card transactions. It's a small hiccup in an otherwise stellar dining experience but one worth noting nonetheless. Overall, my experience at Chikaros was nothing short of exceptional.

"The place is lovely. Lovely servers and lovely atmosphere, however, every time I happen to go in there, the range is extremely limited because they lack the ingredients. All times I have been, my order has been declined numerous times as they can not make them. For example, my most recent encounter involves me trying to order a smoothie. When told they ca n't make my specific smoothie, they mentioned they can make any of the other smoothie options so I picked one of those. A few minutes later they come back to me saying they ca n't make any of the smoothies as they have ran out of juice. At this point, it has n't even reached peak hours. On top of this, there were hardly any cakes on display and the pastries were n't fresh whatsoever. I really tried to enjoy it but the fact that the range is so limited makes it incredibly difficult to accommodate people who have certain intolerances. For example, I'm lactose intolerant and the only other lactose free drink to my knowledge was water as no where did they advertise alternative milk options. I ended up asking for a hot chocolate instead and giving it to my partner who complained how it tasted like it had n't been mixed at all. For the prices, there is definitely room for improvement regarding the drinks and food. I'm disappointed to say the least.",0,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

"Stayed here from Tuesday 2nd till Friday 5th. As with any Premier Inn, they a budget hotel that provides what you need, at a reasonable price without the frills. The staff; all excellent, very friendly and happy to attend to all needs despite the reception staff seemingly doing everything from Kitchen, Waitering and of course manning the reception. All staff I encountered are 5 *. The rooms; as you would expect, basic but functional. They were very clean all bar a little stain on the sheet but did n't impact my stay. Only downside I occurred is the toilet paper, it is in a dispenser and provides singular sheets, as with all premier inns, I not a fan of this as sometimes it tricky if the sheets do n't dispense a roll is much better. Restaurant; Staff, as mentioned are excellent and very attentive. Food, whilst taste is OK, is nothing special and the menu for the evening meal is extremely limited. Portions are of good size. Breakfast, once again very limited but contains all the essentials. Additional fruit and yogurts would be great though.

The second waitress was a little too eager to take our order; we had only just started looking through the menu, but was happy to wait. We eventually settled on the choc chip cookie dough with salted caramel ice cream( of which there is a vast choice of flavours), a strawberry gelato milkshake, and the Brookie. We were also given a taster plate of 4 macarons. These were far less favourable than our order. The waitress was n't sure of the flavours, but we guessed at 2 x coffee, which we did nt try as we dislike coffee, 1 x pistachio, which did nt taste of anything, and 1 x strawberry, which was quite nondescript, just sweet. As they were complimentary it did nt matter much but if we had paid for a box of them, we would be disappointed, from what we tried. All of them were prepared quickly and were delicious, the Brookie being a particular favourite. Although parking is a bit of an issue, particularly for those who are less able, we are looking forward to coming back again, and will likely recommend it.",1,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

"Went on a whim and ordered here despite my previous abysmal experience with Pizza Hut in Hayes. I was pleasantly surprised. The first thing I noticed was the pizza had not been overcooked. The crust golden, like it had been soaking in the rays on a picturesque Caribbean beach. Perfectly moist and spongy as one would expect. Secondly, the cheese was there. Usually I am second guessing myself, wondering if I had accidentally clicked the' Extra Dough' option when ordering, rather than extra cheese. This time it had visibly slid across the surface of the pizza in transit due to the sheer weight and consistency-something that I wo n't deduct points for. Anyway, having a few slices with a bit less cheese, knowing you are going to reach those absolutely coated came as quite an exciting and almost tense ordeal. The sauce was plenty ladled, and because the pizza was n't overcooked, the toppings were juicy and tender. Remember, if we want pepperoni crisps we will just buy them from the shop. I guess this time the person preparing the pizza is a connoisseur themselves; or they just care about their customers. All in all, great experience.",1,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

You did n't order food. Indeed I did. The lady from bar turned up after serving a customer. She apologised that being in a rush making other people order before us she forgot our food. She offered our food on the house at this point. She kept on apologizing. She was an excellent employee and 5 * customer service from her! The waitresses still did n't bother.

We have a brilliant culture of around the arts, food and sports which can and should be celebrated. This SHOULD be done as a bank holiday more should be done by Government with celebrations. When you look around the world I doubt you would find a culture that hates itself as much as the English. More people go out for St Patrick's day than St Georges which is disappointing.

The plan itself, to send them to another country for processing isn't actually illegal so they should be able to find a safe country to do this.
Simply declaring Rwanda officially safe is insane, particularly as there are Rwandan refugees fleeing from Rwanda who have applied for asylum in the UK.
The Home office won't talk about this, but i suspect that the finances won't stand up for scrutiny and i suspect that the UK taxpayer has financed those Rwandan homes their government is currently selling off that Cruella Slaverman admired so much.
Rwanda is yet another black hole for taxpayer's money and the National Debt is about to hit 3 trillion. (3,000,000,000,000).

My mum wasn't a well woman, she had MS and was bed bound, had carers coming in to see her 4 times a day and after my dad passed in November the rest of the time it was just me to take care of her and I failed her. For the last few months of her life she had constant UTI's and was in a constant state of confusion with them.

One morning I had to phone 999 as I couldn't get her to wake and ended up having to perform chest compressions on her.

I thought I was leaving her in good hands and I needed to help my brother in law with my nephews. Anyhoo 6 hours after being taken she was discharged. A subsequent conversation with the advanced nurse practitioner as my mum was found eating tissue paper I mentioned she had just been in hospital and this practitioner said she wouldn't have been discharged if there was anything wrong and asked me if I wanted her in hospital. I said I just wanted what was best for my mum. She gave my mum a once over and said she could only treat what was in front of her despite me saying that my mum wasn't one to be snacking on fucking tissue paper.

Its always warm and there seems, in the UK no Food and Safety, like the US to require cooking and serving your burger hot at Burger King seriously fix your app. Heck contact me and I'll work with you on it.",0,en-UK,Google,Sarcasm
Gorgeous college with lovely places to walk around and soak the green air and the nature! Deer park in the middle always make me feel happy and having such a vast ground space really gives a good amount of walking in the college. I love the chapel and the quads as well.

"I had a disappointing experience at the restaurant last night When I went to order at the counter, the staff told me to use the self-service kiosks instead. While I understand they are promoting this new technology, the young blonde woman came across as rude in her approach. I did n't receive a paper receipt at the end. After waiting 10 minutes to receive my food, I noticed concerning practices like staff picking their nose while preparing food! Keeping food warm in the fry station. Multiple staff members had untidy uniforms with only one wearing an apron, which made me wonder about the general hygiene standards. While most of the staff seemed totally lost, only two employees who stood out in a positive way and knew what they were doing I do n't know their names but the tall man with glasses who was out the back and the female employee bagging orders at the fry station. I left feeling disappointed by the unclean conditions, poor service and difficult technology. I hope Burger King can work out these kinks because I believe there is an opportunity to improve.",0,en-UK,Google,Sarcasm

There might be a little wait and not always someone at the desk but I ca n't fault them.

A staff member referred to me as she / her( I identify as non-binary and my pronouns are they them their, my title is Mx) but I respect that in this day and age we are still brought up that way, I politely corrected her and she was genuinely apologetic about it I assured her it was OK. No offence was taken.:- There is a little wait for room service such as food but they always remember and the attitude and manners are amazing, they do their best to have a bit of chit chat. They were great interacting with my pooch. And the bed they provided, I want it! And the little doggy bag gifts and treats made me emotional because it was so thoughtful! And generous! The standard double I had at first the temperature controls I think froze but they kindly helped me move rooms where they worked helping me carry my belongings. I ca n't thank everyone enough for being so kind with me, polite, friendly, helpful, caring and welcoming. Top quality service.

The service was slow and inefficient, resulting in frustratingly long wait times. The restaurant cleanliness was questionable, and the limited seating options made it difficult to find a place to sit and enjoy the meal. The menu lacked variety and the prices felt high for the quality and service provided. The customer service was lacking, with uninterested and unhelpful employees. Inaccurate orders were also a frequent occurrence. Overall, I left KFC feeling unsatisfied and unlikely to return.",0,en-UK,Google,Sarcasm

I was truly expecting to be wowed because of the great reviews. I do n't know if it was the chef on duty or if everyone was tired and did n't care about the customers but the experience was nothing to write home about. Atmosphere The interior is picturesque and has great lighting but when we got in, there were still used plates on a table or two. The table beside us was sprayed with cleaning agent and was just left there it began to sting my eyes. Had to remind our host to please wipe off what he sprayed on it. Food The starter was just ok. The skewers were n't well seasoned and I made mention of it. The linguine pasta was cold and so oily. There were no sauces or dips at all and when i asked for chilli I was served mild sriracha sauce swimming in oil The food was so greasy I used up our serviettes wiping oil off my mouth. My husband asked for tomato sauce and was served ketchup Had to force our way through it because we were very hungry. I told the host I did n't enjoy it. We wanted to order desserts and asked for the menu infact but the main was so bad, we called it a wrap there. Other The menu is very limited. We noticed at least two customers walk in, scan the menu and walk out. An older couple who came in sat for almost 10 minutes before they were attended to.

"mainly due to the "" loaded fries "" I say that loosely. The main reason for Nandoes was to try the loaded fries, and was just mega disappointed. But I'll get to that at the end. Sunset Burger: Absolutely lovely, and tasty. Around on its own I believe, and then instead of going for the sides we opted for the loaded fries as another dish instead. The burger as a stand alone item would be. Loaded fries: Do n't get fooled by advertisement. It was 8, and I tasted 5 too much. Firstly the loaded element, which was hard to find any chicken it claimed to have in, I think I counted around 3 strands. And then alot of the loaded, is very central, so you feel there is no flavour else where. The main issue is the flavour / taste, the only way to describe it, is it tasted like the old mini oven pizzas I used to have when I was younger. The taste was identical to that pizza, which was so odd to have that cheap oven pizza taste on chips. It did n't have any unique flavours, or any spice. We had to drown it in hot sauce, to then get Hot Oven Pizza flavour. Honestly I would n't recommend it at all, it's not worth disappointing yourself for 8. Stick to what you know, and get the usual with 2 normal sides. And stay away from the odd flavours loaded fries. Shame!",0,en-UK,Google,Sarcasm

"Went on a whim and ordered here despite my previous abysmal experience with Pizza Hut in Hayes. I was pleasantly surprised. The first thing I noticed was the pizza had not been overcooked. The crust golden, like it had been soaking in the rays on a picturesque Caribbean beach. Perfectly moist and spongy as one would expect. Secondly, the cheese was there. Usually I am second guessing myself, wondering if I had accidentally clicked the' Extra Dough' option when ordering, rather than extra cheese. This time it had visibly slid across the surface of the pizza in transit due to the sheer weight and consistency-something that I wo n't deduct points for. Anyway, having a few slices with a bit less cheese, knowing you are going to reach those absolutely coated came as quite an exciting and almost tense ordeal. The sauce was plenty ladled, and because the pizza was n't overcooked, the toppings were juicy and tender. Remember, if we want pepperoni crisps we will just buy them from the shop. I guess this time the person preparing the pizza is a connoisseur themselves; or they just care about their customers. All in all, great experience.",0,en-UK,Google,Sarcasm

I do n't like their Chai as it is simple cinnamon machine tea which Indian may not like.. service is great. Love their garlic naan, railway chicken...

Did n't have breakfast but Premier Inn breakfast is usually pretty good. Docking a star as the water in the sink was draining very slowly, and I found a pill( ? ? ?) on the floor, which is obviously quite the health and safety risk for people travelling with young children.",0,en-UK,Google,Sarcasm

Situated across from Victoria station and bus garage along from Victoria theatre. The Staff are friendly. The Prices are ok for the central London Victoria area. Plenty of beers on tap and ciders on tap. The Food is what to expect from a Witherspoon not award winning but decent enough to fill a hole. Enough seating for one hundred people.,0,en-UK,Google,Sarcasm

Lovely place got busy quite quick( came on a Sat day). Very modern looking and do food here which I did n't try this visit. Cocktail menu is quite extensive and in the week its 2-4-1 and cocktails which works out a good price and they are really good. They are a tad pricey though if you come when it's not 2-4-1.,0,en-UK,Google,Sarcasm
"A very easy option if you have people with varying tastes. No need to book, although you can if you want to be sure. The carvery choice was good and the mash potato and roast potatoes were delicious. Outside seating next to a large open green space.

"First time trying Uyghur food, overall very delicious mains and great value for money. Lambtugur dumplings: delicious, dough is thicker than other Asian dumplings I had, almost similar to a pelmeni. The meat is well seasoned and goes well with the vinegary chilli oil Diced Leghmen: was intrigued by the idea of diced noodles and it definitely delivered. There was a great crunch from the veg, the sauce was spicy, numbing and a little funky which was delicious. Kept having more! Etles spicy trotters: the sauce on this is truly exceptional, I personally love the texture of trotters so I really enjoyed this dish, maybe something for the more adventurous eaters as my friend did n't like the texture( but still loved the sauce). Honey cake: dense and oddly cold, was n't the best honey cake I had. If I were to come to Etles again I stick to the mains! The staff is friendly, food comes out quick, overall great value for money with large portion sizes. Enjoyed it!",0,en-UK,Google,Sarcasm
"We just did a walk in but we were accommodated immediately, staff at the door was very friendly. Big place with lots of seats, place was very cozy and they have a sauce bar where you can choose which ones suits your taste. They have kid menu as well.

We took Aloo Tikki chat-Bigger portion could have been a good idea there and would have preferred a flat presentation rather than the small bowl, which was difficult to eat. Service was good. Especially enjoyed the special request they fulfilled for Pickle and Onion to go with the food. Surprised to see it was charged though when we saw the bill. Would certainly recommend for the great tasting food and big portion sizes overall.",0,en-UK,Google,Sarcasm

I ordered the Bombay Fried Chicken Burger-Buttermilk fried chicken with mature cheddar, mango chutney, curry mayo, crispy onions, tomato and lettuce. Delicious with a bit of a kick. Then for dessert I had White Chocolate & Vanilla Cheesecake with berry compote and maple mascarpone. What looked a small portion was just right, and not overly sweet. Liked that we could all pay separately at the till when we had finished our meal. Was n't overly busy for a Thursday evening, but nice we could all chat without having to shout over loud music.",0,en-UK,Google,Sarcasm

Very overpriced paid over 38 extra for slush puppies that where too frozen. Some areas where really dark with lights either broken or not on. Partner got whiplash from the soft play as it was so poorly lit he smacked his head on a post. No air con & the escalators did n't work. Could n't fault our party host she was brilliant but would n't go back here. Very overpriced and very minimal food options.",0,en-UK,Google,Sarcasm

Disappointed, I hate giving reviews but there is no complaint email for Papa John, so.",0,en-UK,Google,Sarcasm
"The best breakfast place in Plymouth. It gets busy quickly, but if you arrive before you should be able to get a table without a wait. Otherwise expect a queue. Eggs Benedict were perfect. Liked the breakfast bagel, but was n't so keen on the sausage patty on it. Great cappuccino. Be aware that you pay when you order and they ask up front for a tip even before you are served.",0,en-UK,Google,Sarcasm

"The staff are fantastic, so friendly and welcoming, and had a bit of a laugh and joke around with us, including joking around with my step daughters as they were getting their pick and mix. This helped to make the evening a bit more fun and enjoyable. Our film was on screen 3, I think it was. It was fine, the screen was large and sound was good. We sat towards the back in the middle, so viewing angles were great. The negative, though, were the seats, which were a little uncomfortable, especially as it got toward the end of the film. Because of this, I've removed a star. Overall, I'd recommend coming here, and we will be heading back for sure.",0,en-UK,Google,Sarcasm
First time going here and as soon as you walk though the door you can smell the desserts which was nice and the atmosphere was lovely too. There were a few of us so had to wait a couple of minutes while they set some tables up. The staff were really friendly and the desserts that we ordered all looked amazing. We all enjoyed what we ordered. The desserts are n't cheap but it's nice to treat yourself once in a while so I would definitely come back again.,0,en-UK,Google,Sarcasm
"Food was ok, but the size for 10 inch does n't even look like 10 inch, it was 15 ? Bit excessive to me, I asked for fanta but they gave me tango, and paid for that too ? Not really fancying ordering again if mistakes like this was made.",0,en-UK,Google,Sarcasm

I was waiting for an order and it was taking a while however Manali made sure I was felt comfortable and welcome and gave me a free drink whilst my order was being made.

The interior is very smart and well maintained. The bar staff are pretty friendly and attentive. The bar offers a good range of decent ales and lager. You wo n't find the lower tier Australian and American lagers served here. The food menu is simple and straightforward as expected of a small kitchen. The burgers in particular are well made here. At the rear of the premises is a very nice out door / beer garden area, which is often heaving in the summer. Most Saturday nights you can expect to see a live band preform and this often draw quite a throng so be aware of if you are planning quiet Saturday night drink.",0,en-UK,Google,Sarcasm

"Food was lovely, however I would not recommend if you are vegetarian. They served my vegetarian partner a meat samosa instead of a vegetable samosa, he took a bite and was rather upset.

We were given 10 % off of the bill but that did not make up for the lack of customer service and apology.",0,en-UK,Google,Sarcasm

"A group of 12 of us booked this place for a leaving function, due to some people arriving late there were complications caused by our party. The staff handled everything very well and were extremely accommodating throughout what must have been a frustrating process for them. Eventually we had 2 lanes sorted out and a thoroughly enjoyable time! Car parking is easy with a number of facilities in the area, payment for parking is best through an app we have discovered. It also free after 1600 in the carpark we chose. The bowling centre is located on the second floor of the building, there are stairs available as well as a lift should you need it. Inside the place is spacious with plenty of seating for eating food and drinks, quite a few arcade games are also available; some you can win tickets on these can be exchanged for prizes. The bowling itself is well maintained and set out allowing up to 6 people per lane, we had 2 lanes next to each other for our group. Military discount is available making it around 8 per game, table service from the bar can be achieved by scanning a QR code from the small table at your lane. Based on this experience I would highly recommend this place for some light hearted fun.",0,en-UK,Google,Sarcasm

"The food is great, huge portions, very tasty, pretty cheap. I've always had good service when I went, but it is more like a cafe that serves big meals than a restaurant, so it's a different style of service. I would probably go here more often if they took card, as I rarely have cash on me. They also do n't have an alcohol licence, which makes perfect sense for the size and style of the place.

Service charge was automatically added to bill",0,en-UK,Google,Sarcasm
A really great food hall with plenty of choice. After a lot of deliberation I chose to eat at the market cafe which was excellent. There are few market stalls too.

"were a few things I did n't understand, and I think it's very unnecessary, first of all, the security guards who met you at the door take you through the passport check-in, as if they're taking you through the bag check-in, the top search check-in, the ticket check-out, and the water you have on you, they Decoy you to security in detail, so this security is too much of an exaggeration, because we're going to enter a roller coaster on the bottom Another issue that I'm uncomfortable with is that sometimes on the roller rink we stepped aside to take a breath and relax, I was n't even allowed to take a photo with my friend, we were standing in a place where we would n't disturb anyone, the skating officials inside told us to get off the rink to relax, was it worth getting off the rink for a minute, it's really ridiculous The staff inside are very respectful and very in love with their work people standing at the door motivated us very much with the style of the cloakroom gentleman and his smiling face.

The service was immaculate and the majority of the staff were friendly and helpful( although when we arrived I had to offer that we had a reservation). Overall, we all enjoyed the food. The English muffin with the chicken liver parfait was unbelievably good, but very small. The cassoulet with the cod lacked flavour sadly and the crumb was quite wet, but the fish was cooked well. With some fine tuning this place could be a real gem. Having said that we will definitely be back and would expect Tarragon to continue to rise in popularity.",0,en-UK,Google,Sarcasm

Food: I had the best Cortado so far, amazing taste. By curiosity I always watch the baristas make my coffee but, this was was different, there was no hurry and the espresso was well blended with a whisk before they poured the milk in, took the bitterness and a smooth cortado for us. I was impressed. Now I am not going to Costa for my Cortado. The Cookies and Cream Brownie was not wow but good enuf with the coffee.

"First time visit today-we will be coming back. The first waitress was quick to seat us with menus, which are pretty extensive. The second waitress was a little too eager to take our order; we had only just started looking through the menu, but was happy to wait. We eventually settled on the choc chip cookie dough with salted caramel ice cream( of which there is a vast choice of flavours), a strawberry gelato milkshake, and the Brookie. We were also given a taster plate of 4 macarons. These were far less favourable than our order. The waitress was n't sure of the flavours, but we guessed at 2 x coffee, which we did nt try as we dislike coffee, 1 x pistachio, which did nt taste of anything, and 1 x strawberry, which was quite nondescript, just sweet. As they were complimentary it did nt matter much but if we had paid for a box of them, we would be disappointed, from what we tried. All of them were prepared quickly and were delicious, the Brookie being a particular favourite. Although parking is a bit of an issue, particularly for those who are less able, we are looking forward to coming back again, and will likely recommend it.",0,en-UK,Google,Sarcasm

It's understandable that such a popular place has a large roll over of customers as the night goes on so i guess this can be looked at as a positive and a negative view point, it's the been told you only have half an hr left at your table and then kinda felt we are being forced out and having a staff member settling your bill on their terms... i get it and see they are thinking about new customers ect.. so it feels like ok your done guy now move on.

Please enlighten me and in particular please enlighted the public and your future customers. A fillet does not have any tendons in it, nor there is any fat, it is a pure piece of meat!

"The last Gov report showed the cost to the UK of reoffending was around 18 billion a year. 
The same statistics put the cost of housing a prisoner each year somewhere around 50k.
In the UK currently we have 95k people in prison.
Let's say we invest 10 of that lost 18 billion into increased prison capacity. That would house an additional 200k people. We could literally triple our prison population and still be saving money. This whole economic benefit of releasing people is a myth.
People have this fairy tinted view that everyone can be reformed, they can't. It's not uncommon for prolific offenders to have anywhere from 100-300 convictions. Releasing them does nothing but bring more misery into their local communities because it is a certainty they will reoffend.
The whole myth around increased punishment isn't a deterrent argument falls apart as well when scrutinised. How many of you would walk down the streets in the UK and smoke a joint? - Not worried about it right.. - Now how many of you would do the same in Singapore or Dubai? - Not so willing to are you, why? - Because you are shit scared of the consequences there, don't nobody want to go to a Dubai Jail.

"There are 2 doctors in my surgery to cover over 8000 people and I feel that this understaffing played a part in my mum's death.   
My mum wasn't a well woman, she had MS and was bed bound, had carers coming in to see her 4 times a day and after my dad passed in November the rest of the time it was just me to take care of her and I failed her. For the last few months of her life she had constant UTI's and was in a constant state of confusion with them. No doctor came out to see her despite my having to phone the practice every other week and a couple of times an advanced nurse practitioner came out. One morning I had to phone 999 as I couldn't get her to wake and ended up having to perform chest compressions on her. Long story short I had to leave her after a few hours as my sister was taken into hospital that same day and almost passed that night due to sepsis. I thought I was leaving her in good hands and I needed to help my brother in law with my nephews. Anyhoo 6 hours after being taken she was discharged. A subsequent conversation with the advanced nurse practitioner as my mum was found eating tissue paper I mentioned she had just been in hospital and this practitioner said she wouldn't have been discharged if there was anything wrong and asked me if I wanted her in hospital. I said I just wanted what was best for my mum. She gave my mum a once over and said she could only treat what was in front of her despite me saying that my mum wasn't one to be snacking on fucking tissue paper. Anyway another antibiotic was prescribed as it was probably just another UTI. Five days later my mum passed due to sepsis.",0,en-UK,Reddit,Sarcasm

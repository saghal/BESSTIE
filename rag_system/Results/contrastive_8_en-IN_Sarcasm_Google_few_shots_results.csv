Best cafe in kottayam situated opposite to Ceaser Palace. Got ample car parking. Opens upto 12 am. Staffs are super friendly. I am a reqular customer since their initial time. Found best in town at that time. But today sad to say that the items are not consistent in taste wise. Best dishes # Steak with mashed potato and sauted veggies # tikka with afgani rice # crispy fried burger # crumb fried sausages # penne pasta with meat balls # loaded Fries # Club sandwich # Fried samoosa # hot chocolate( advised not to add extra sugar as it is already sweeetened) # Lemon ice tea # juices # waffles # Ceaser salad # Brownie # coffee # shakes # blood Mary mojitos Juicy Lucy burger is not that ones which we get in abroad. Not recommended. Outdoor seating is there. Advised to sit outside if you are planning for a date or a meeting beacuse the music that they are playing is at high volume and can cause irritation. They got a massive 75 inch television for live matches. Got barista machine. Clean and neat washroom is there. Even if you tell them for rare or medium rare beef steak you will get only welldone UPI and POS is there. Never expect taste consistency.

Really well. 2. Tandoori was awesome, best tandoori in. Chirala. No resturant in chirala provide Mayo( dawat, kanaka Durga) but they provide. Green chutney was superb. 3.

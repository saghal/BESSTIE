"Centrum is a very good hotel and located right in place. Mathura bus stand is just a neighbour and the train station is also not too far. Rooms are big enough to accommodate committed people but house keeping service can be one of the best in cost range, they have their own parking for the guests but do n't have dorm for drivers, so you need to arrange a stay for your driver. They have a very good and known food stall, where you can enjoy a yummy veg meal, sweats etc. You can get room service from their restaurant. There are multiple other hotels also if you want to eat somewhere outside.",1,1,True,en-IN,Google

The bar is kinda not up to the standards of a family restaurant. It gives off a seedy vibe which makes it not a good place to be with one family. While the Indian food served in this place is quite delectable the Chinese food is a real horror! There's no swimming pool.

"Hordes of people, a wall like rack lined with packets of bread, that's the way to spot Madhuram Sandwich. Situated diagonally opposite to the famous Kaanch mandir, this small shop is Indore hidden gem for sandwich lovers. It sells unexpectedly good. Generously layered with Paneer cubes, capsicum, onion, cucumber and some tandoori mayo, these sandwiches are huge. It would n't be wrong to call it a huge club sandwich. Served with coriander chutney, ketchup and potato wafers, the sandwich is liberally topped with sev, jeeravan, mayo and cheese. The perfect combination for Indori taste buds. In short, a plate of sandwich can easily suffice two. Trust me, it's true. For me, even finishing three pieces of the sandwich was difficult. So if you plan on having this sandwich, make sure you have ample space in your tummy and do n't plan to order anything else, because you wo n't be able to eat anything after the sandwich. With just 5 bench tables to sit on and 3-4 tiny tables to stand and eat, the shop offers a decent space to accommodate the customers. A lot of people opt for take away and you can do so if you do n't like sitting on the street side to eat. The best part, this enormous sandwich is priced at Rs 150 only and reaches you in just 10 mins. Is n't it wow! Light on your pocket and light on the wait time as well. Check out Madhuram Sandwich when you crave for a great sandwich the next time and sink in this delicious street delicacy. Enjoy!",1,1,True,en-IN,Google

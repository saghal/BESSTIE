"We visited the Ivy for a birthday celebration and were very disappointed. The server did not understand the menu and gave us wrong information regarding vegetarian options multiple times. We were then given a vegetarian menu and upon ordering, we were told the menu was out of date and the options had changed / were unavailable. The afternoon tea was also below the usual standard as the sandwiches were dry / stale and the chocolate dessert was topped with canned whipped cream, followed by a whole pot of watery chocolate sauce. The other cakes were also underwhelming and it was no surprise the table next to us left their cakes uneaten. Very disappointing experience.",0,0,True,en-UK,Google

"Food was great and I recommend as it matched my pakistani taste buds  but following observations. 1. No menu card( I do n't know why) 2. Ordered lamb Haneed, One portion with rice, but if one person is eating they charge 15, if two persons are eating they charge 19 for the same quantity of food, reason, I do n't know. 3. I did n't get the free banana, other tables where Africans were eating, they gave banana, not to us. Sad. 4. I was with family, so sat in family area which was alright  but it was noisy in the restaurant. 5. Chili sauce, was very very very hot, did n't like it  but lemon soup was fantastic and soooper yummy. 6. Staff was n't understanding english much  it was tough to communicate.. but they were friendly. 7. I will still recommend for the taste.",1,1,True,en-UK,Google
"I had a Rogan Josh curry with chicken and Garlic naan bread, it was nice. The food was filling and a good portion, I really enjoyed the chicken. My only gripe is that it did take a while to turn up, about an hour but they did say 45 minutes to an hour on the phone so I'm appreciative that they were honest about the wait time, only reason I'm not giving 5 stars, will be ordering again though as the curry was flavorful and the chicken was really good.",1,1,True,en-UK,Google

We always try to pop in for a meal when we visit Cambridge.",1,1,True,en-UK,Google
"Overall for a first time we would give it out of 5. Quiet midweek night out for 6 of us and pretty empty but inside is nice and inviting. The 2 staff that was on were nice friendly and happy to help with questions so 5 stars with service. Used a coupon for a free garlic bread which was pretty small so we got a small bit each but was average taste but free so ca n't complain on that. Drinks. Cokes etc came in bottles nicely presented with glass ice lemon but they are small and draughts are better option maybe. Tried a new cocktail which I think is pricey at nearly 9 and small no razzle dazzle. Food. Most had safer option of spaghetti bolognese and while you got a big bowl full, it was alot of spaghetti and not enough sauce which was pretty standard in flavour and we did n't think was worth nearly 15 same price as the pizza its alot and both were inconsistent in size as you can see in pics with one far smaller than the other. I tried a new dish off the new signature beef and chianti ragu. Looked amazing online with the description. Pasta tasted lovely, good presentation and filling however again was was missing the cheese topping and tasted good but after a few mouthfuls I was not tasting the flavours I expected but was similar to the bolognese sauce. 3 people had desserts, 2 melting puddings and 1 brownie sundae which had nice presentation again roughly 7. I would visit again but with not such a big group due to costs but we still enjoyed the evening and enjoyable just not fantastic. I m no food critic just an honest reviewer:",1,1,True,en-UK,Google

Have stayed at this Novotel close to 10 times in the past 1 year and the primary reason for my preference is the location as it is right at the center of the town and many many great food options nearby. The overall service is very good and the staff of the hotel is also very friendly. The rooms are quiet and well furnished but the sofas in all the rooms were pretty dated and used. The fitness room is pretty standard and the pool sauna is also nice to have. Would recommend but is overall a mid ranged costing option in Reading center.,1,1,True,en-UK,Google

They have a VAST menu on one side wall. Other amenities( restroom for customers, washbasin) as well as seating area is pretty limited. But you go here for the great taste of their food, not to sit down for a leisurely meal.

"Well McDonalds Food is always tasty. I think the electronic ordering stations inside the store are a great idea, but I think you need to add another one more atleast to make it run more efficiently especially at lunchtimes, and other busy times, because when people have a short time to get food within their break times from work, it can be very frustrating.

"I had the vegan fiesta burger meal which comes with chips and 6 onion rings. You can choose to have this meal with a soft drink or alcohol. I chose the raspberry lemonade. It was a busy lunchtime on a Wednesday afternoon. The person who served me did n't know that my meal came with a drink. The person who served my meal just put it down in front of me and walked off. Service was n't friendly but the food came fairly quickly. I sat outside. Unfortunately, the nicer seats out in the sun are for smokers and non-smokers have to sit in the shade. The meal itself was tasty.",1,1,True,en-UK,Google
"The staff are fantastic, so friendly and welcoming, and had a bit of a laugh and joke around with us, including joking around with my step daughters as they were getting their pick and mix. This helped to make the evening a bit more fun and enjoyable. Our film was on screen 3, I think it was. It was fine, the screen was large and sound was good. We sat towards the back in the middle, so viewing angles were great. The negative, though, were the seats, which were a little uncomfortable, especially as it got toward the end of the film. Because of this, I've removed a star. Overall, I'd recommend coming here, and we will be heading back for sure.",1,1,True,en-UK,Google

"Came here to celebrate something special. Got in at 7 pm, first drink came at which was fine. Then came the wait. We complained then the meal got served along with the second drink after we said we were leaving. The wait was n't great, no one explained anything until we complained. After we finished eating the very bland food, we waited another 15 minutes before our tables got cleared. This was after the waiter passed our table several times without paying any attention to us. We had already ordered dessert along with the main meal  but we still had to wait again after our main dishes had been cleared to even get that. Not sure I ever be back after this encounter that has left me feeling annoyed by everything( the service & the food). Not great at all because I had lost all my appetite by the time dessert was served.",0,0,True,en-UK,Google

Decent place with good selection of shakes available. The problem I had was that the shake was a little too thick which made it extremely hard for me to have with the straw they provided with the shake. The shake taste was a little below average.

"Glen Hansard nothing wrong with Glen or Ticketmaster-this is for the venue operation or event-sec staff-they caused issues by stopping patrons re-entering the concert standing area( after using the lavatories, phone calls or purchasing drinks within the rest of the venue grounds). Stated they were "" trying something new "" and that patrons could n't enter until the current song was over, therefore missing the vast majority of some songs. Some doors operated this, others did n't. At times I was stopped, I was kept stood beside the doors that continued to open to allow people to exit to go to the lavatory, also get hit and injured by the doors as those feeling unwell were rushed out the side doors. The large double doors were regularly opening anyway due to ppl exiting, just let those who exited back in.

I always used to have their vegetarian breakfast wraps, but I had to stop ordering them because they started looking like someone had thrown the wrap around the kitchen before making it. Plus they do n't melt the cheese and because its like a slice of cheddar when you bite into it its a weird sensation, you get all the hot from the hash browns etc then you reach this cold mush. It is n't great. However, I have now found the sausage muffins, and they are beautiful. For less than 5 I can get a quorn muffin, with an unlimited hot drink and hash brown! Honestly it is such an amazing deal. I would highly recommend, especially if you like a maccys breakfast, I'd go to butlers Bell over maccys any day of the week. The staff are all so lovely. Always full of smiles. Especially this one lady, I wish I knew her name, she's blonde, so kindly spoken, she works so hard, I swear she never has a day off, every time I've been there she's been on shift.

"My dining experience left me slightly disappointed as the meal quantity fell short of my expectations. Despite the speedy preparation, the portion size failed to match that of other McDonald outlets in the city. The table untidiness further added to the less-than-ideal atmosphere.

The flavors and quality of the food continue to be a commendable aspect, providing a satisfying culinary experience. While the quantity and tidiness aspects may have left room for improvement, the unwavering taste quality reaffirms McDonald commitment to delivering a consistently delicious dining experience.

"I used to belong to the Stratford Picture House when it was a clean, nice place and the benefits were good. I went with a friend as she had a couple of free tickets and I was gobsmacked at how run down it has become. The floors were dirty and fraying all over the place. The cafe now closed so the 10 % off food is now the junk they serve at the popcorn and pop counter. I used to enjoy a decent coffee upstairs with a bite to eat and my discount. The cafe is closed and the seating area is old worn out and so uninspiring. It's not worth the membership price any longer I am afraid to say. The Art house in Crouch end offers a better deal now with a lovely cafe and amazing membership prices. My friend has now joined the Art house cinema and has not renewed her Picture House one. It's a shame because it used to be a beautiful place to go I have added this last paragraph a couple of days later after reading most of the reviews. The cinema clearly does not take any notice of the reviews and do n't even respond. One can only assume it is out of their control and it is a case of poor facilities, lack of staff and no money available to make any upgrades. Such a shame.",0,0,True,en-UK,Google

"Kerala Hut in Luton is a delightful gem for anyone craving authentic South Indian cuisine. The ambience of the restaurant transports you straight to the heart of Kerala with its warm, inviting decor and traditional music that sets the perfect mood for a culinary adventure. The Kizhi Parotta is a standout dish, a flaky, layered flatbread that cooked to perfection and served with a side of spicy, flavorful curry that complements it beautifully. It a must-try for anyone visiting the restaurant. Another highlight is the Chatti Chor, a rich and aromatic biryani cooked in a traditional clay pot, which seals in all the flavors and spices, resulting in a dish that both comforting and exotic. Overall, Kerala Hut offers a fantastic dining experience with its combination of delicious food, lovely ambience, and friendly service.

"Interesting place. Food was nice, though the choices were a little limited for my tastes. The organisation and service was excellent and ca n't be faulted at all, fantastic staff all round. Space at our table was very tight( there were eight of us) especially during our meal but that is n't a deal breaker for me as they were utilising space as they could on a busy night. The entertainment was reminiscent of a cabaret at an all-inclusive holiday hotel and a Haven caravan site. It was loosely themed on Moulin Rouge tonight and was heavily audience participative. The night ended with half of the punters doing the locomotion around the place and then dancing next to their tables. The overall experience was certainly not what I was expecting and in all fairness was n't really my sort of thing, but it was certainly' an experience' and a lot of the people in tonight seemed to love it. Prices of food and drink were a bit higher than other places and a ticket was required( just under 20). I'd recommend the place if you like this participative cabaret type of night or for a themed Christmas party.",1,1,True,en-UK,Google

Some of the dishes are served to you at ur table and quick items like ur coffee and other ready to eats are to be taken by you. Service: Quick service and good baristas. Food: I had the best Cortado so far, amazing taste. By curiosity I always watch the baristas make my coffee but, this was was different, there was no hurry and the espresso was well blended with a whisk before they poured the milk in, took the bitterness and a smooth cortado for us. I was impressed. Now I am not going to Costa for my Cortado. The Cookies and Cream Brownie was not wow but good enuf with the coffee.

I had the Big Kiwi breakfast as I wanted as close to quality tasty traditional / Irish breakfast as I could get here. The bacon was streaky. I prefer back bacon as I do n't want loads of fat. The sausage lacked taste. They had ciabatta which was very hard on the edges. Would have preferred some quality bread toasted but that just my preference. It probably just not the place for me.

"Unfortunate Birthday at Nando: Seeking a laid-back atmosphere for my New Year Eve birthday while I was feeling unwell, Nando seemed like the perfect choice  until our dinner plans turned into disappointment. The news of running out of whole chicken extended our wait to 30-40 minutes. Hoping to salvage the evening, we ordered chicken livers as a starter, priced at a hefty 9. To our surprise, it arrived as a small bowl with a single bread roll, and an extra roll set us back another quid! As a proud Portuguese, I can whip up a pot at a fraction of the cost. The seemingly dry reheated livers and stale extra roll only added insult to injury. To compound matters, our meal was slightly undercooked when it arrived, necessitating a return to the grill. By the time we finally sat down to eat at 9 pm, an hour later, the restaurant was closing, leaving us no choice but to take our meal away. The saving grace ? The staff friendliness. Nando, charging a premium for mediocre dishes, wo n't cut it. What is happening to British hospitality ? Portions and quality are decreasing, yet prices are rising!",0,0,True,en-UK,Google

Everything was very tasty, all the pork products on my brunch were well cooked without being dry the pancakes were nice and fluffy. The Butches Brunch was a bit pork-heavy for my liking and could have used something to lighten it a little, perhaps grilled tomato or mushrooms to cut through all the meat and the pancakes could have the option of some yoghurt to enhance them, none the less we enjoyed our lunch very much and want to return for breakfasts or dinner soon.

"This cinema has to be one of the cheapest cinemas around! Less than 6 per person, even when booking our tickets online. My husband and I went at the end of March.

It was rather old looking, much like the rest of the cinema, and very, very slow going both up and down. Anyone who does n't like being in a lift much will probably not like this one, as it is also rather small. Sadly, most of the cinema decor looks old and rather shabby, though the seats in the smaller cinema are quite comfortable and despite my disability I managed a 2hr screening without too much discomfort or fidgeting, which is good for me.

We had a baby with us so we parked up outside and called it in, we get somewhat the same from our local Chinese which are common items so that's fine. 20 min wait which is great, especially since there was a steady stream of customers, always a few cars parked waiting. The price was good maybe slightly higher than our local but within the ball range. The special fired rice was great and so was the gravy and the missus loved hers. But we always get a portion of salt and pepper chips and me being a fatty chicken, I think it was strips. Sadly the range brings it down. Feels more like an after thought than a proper dish.

"Chikaros, nestled in the heart of West Bromwich offers a tantalizing fusion of flavors that cater to diverse palates. During my recent visit, I embarked on a culinary journey that left me both satisfied and impressed. Upon entering the cozy ambiance of Chikaros, I was greeted by the aroma of spices and the welcoming smiles of the staff. The menu, boasting an array of enticing options, immediately caught my attention. From traditional classics to innovative creations, there was something to please every taste bud. I opted for the Chef Kebabish, a delightful combination of succulent meats grilled to perfection and infused with aromatic spices. Each bite was a symphony of flavors, showcasing the culinary expertise of the chefs. The tender meat paired beautifully with the accompanying sauces, creating a harmonious blend of sweet and savory notes. Equally impressive was the Classic Parmesan, a timeless favorite elevated to new heights at Chikaros. The crispy coating gave way to a tender chicken breast, smothered in rich marinara sauce and gooey melted cheese. It was a comforting indulgence that left me craving more. However, despite the culinary delights, I was disappointed to discover that Chikaros does not accept card payments. While this may not deter cash-carrying patrons, it poses an inconvenience for those accustomed to the convenience of card transactions. It's a small hiccup in an otherwise stellar dining experience but one worth noting nonetheless. Overall, my experience at Chikaros was nothing short of exceptional. From the delectable dishes to the warm hospitality, it's clear that this establishment takes pride in delivering memorable dining experiences. Whether you're craving traditional favorites or eager to explore new culinary horizons, Chikaros is sure to delight your senses and leave you coming back for more.",1,1,True,en-UK,Google

"The place is lovely. Lovely servers and lovely atmosphere, however, every time I happen to go in there, the range is extremely limited because they lack the ingredients. All times I have been, my order has been declined numerous times as they can not make them. For example, my most recent encounter involves me trying to order a smoothie. When told they ca n't make my specific smoothie, they mentioned they can make any of the other smoothie options so I picked one of those. A few minutes later they come back to me saying they ca n't make any of the smoothies as they have ran out of juice. At this point, it has n't even reached peak hours. On top of this, there were hardly any cakes on display and the pastries were n't fresh whatsoever. I really tried to enjoy it but the fact that the range is so limited makes it incredibly difficult to accommodate people who have certain intolerances. For example, I'm lactose intolerant and the only other lactose free drink to my knowledge was water as no where did they advertise alternative milk options. I ended up asking for a hot chocolate instead and giving it to my partner who complained how it tasted like it had n't been mixed at all.

"Went on a whim and ordered here despite my previous abysmal experience with Pizza Hut in Hayes. I was pleasantly surprised. The first thing I noticed was the pizza had not been overcooked. The crust golden, like it had been soaking in the rays on a picturesque Caribbean beach. Perfectly moist and spongy as one would expect. Secondly, the cheese was there. Usually I am second guessing myself, wondering if I had accidentally clicked the' Extra Dough' option when ordering, rather than extra cheese. This time it had visibly slid across the surface of the pizza in transit due to the sheer weight and consistency-something that I wo n't deduct points for. Anyway, having a few slices with a bit less cheese, knowing you are going to reach those absolutely coated came as quite an exciting and almost tense ordeal. The sauce was plenty ladled, and because the pizza was n't overcooked, the toppings were juicy and tender. Remember, if we want pepperoni crisps we will just buy them from the shop. I guess this time the person preparing the pizza is a connoisseur themselves; or they just care about their customers. All in all, great experience.",1,1,True,en-UK,Google

"I used to love this place, I've been enough times. But it's just gone so downhill. 4 for 330ml of diet coke. for lime & soda. And 15 for this meal of vegetarian ravioli. It came with the bread. What's that, 2 / piece ?",0,0,True,en-UK,Google
Gorgeous college with lovely places to walk around and soak the green air and the nature! Deer park in the middle always make me feel happy and having such a vast ground space really gives a good amount of walking in the college. I love the chapel and the quads as well. Would have loved to seen the dining hall as well but this seems to not be allowed for visitors. Would love to come back again to see the changes in the seasons!,1,1,True,en-UK,Google
"An amazing restaurant situated in Central MK. From stepping through the doors, Akasaka delivers-with a beautiful bar and pink cherry blossom trees. The staff and service was fantastic exemplary from start to finish. We had the Karage Chicken, Spicy Tuna Rolls and Salmon Maki to start. The Tuna Rolls and Salmon Maki were brilliant, but the Karage chicken a little disappointing. It was the crispiest chicken I have ever eaten, but it was n't very flavoursome-even with the dip. We followed this with Beef Bibimbap and Salmon Bibimbap. Both of these were brilliant-the hot beef comes in a searing hot iron bowl and continues to sizzle the whole time you eating it! The flavour was fantastic and it was nice to be able to ' self sauce ' to personal levels. We had takeaway from here before, but will definitely come back to eat in also in the future!",1,1,True,en-UK,Google
"Foods always good and service to your table is fast, staff are very polite and have a positive attitude( Ipswich) and me and my misses very much enjoy our visits. Only issue I have is the toilets are always in a very poor state sadly and I feel this brings the place down. Maybe employ a cleaner for the toilets GDK as I would n't like the food prepping staff to also be the people who clean the toilets.",1,1,True,en-UK,Google
"Had a Christmas evening meal with large group. Atmosphere ok, drinks expensive, food service fractured as dishes arrived at a slow rate. In all a very expensive evening for what was an average meal 130 per head. Merry Christmas.",0,0,True,en-UK,Google
"The only vegan items are the hash browns, pizza and brownies unfounfately. Not vegan myself but a massive chain like this needs to start having more items on the menu. The lime can be long at peak time but staff are patient and helpful. Good for food on the go. Bottled Drinks are a little expensive... go else to get those, do n't buy with food.",0,0,True,en-UK,Google
"Food is lovely here, we went for the festive menu. Saw a few people having festive afternoon tea which also looked good. Staff friendly, helpful and polite. It was quiet for a Saturday in December but this suited us.",1,1,True,en-UK,Google
Speed of service is average. Ordered food on the McDonald app it took approximately 5min to come to my table. Then I ordered a latte and it took roughly the same time. My latte had a small hair in it which I removed. It was at the top of the cup. Asked for sugar and milk for my drink but I received no stirrer for putting it in. I used my empty fries box to stir my milk and sugar into my latte. So 2 star for this time.,0,0,True,en-UK,Google
As a cathedral I give it 4 *. Not its fault really-it was a church given the status of a cathedral-so it does not have the grant stature of a cathedral building. But a lovely place to visit-has an excellent cafe-had an art / craft market on the day I visited. Has the standard from HMS Sheffield.,1,1,True,en-UK,Google
"Where to start. Firstly our waitress was so bad. Uncaring and not customer focused, slow lady. She took our drink orders and then a lady behind the bar served the drinks to us. I told her that we are ready to make food order. She said it's not her responsibility, but amazingly kindly she came back from the bar and took our order. Where was our waitress at the same time ? Being bored with the other waitresses sort of. We were waiting long minutes and the food did n't arrive. I went to the bored waitresses to ask for my food. Because neither of them( 3) bothered to come to our table for 15 mins to ask if we need anything and the place was n't busy at all by that time. They looked at me with a surprise. Food ? You did n't order food. Indeed I did. The lady from bar turned up after serving a customer. She apologised that being in a rush making other people order before us she forgot our food. She offered our food on the house at this point. She kept on apologizing. She was an excellent employee and 5 * customer service from her! The waitresses still did n't bother. I think the team work is bad here. Why everything is relying on the chef lady ? The food was absolutely amazing. I really enjoyed it. I left the place happily and would return, only because of the chef lady! Who apologised before we left again and I gave her a tip.",0,0,True,en-UK,Google
"been here twice and each time was amazing. there really is n't much to criticise; food is amazing, service is great, atmosphere comfortable. however, we tried the jerk bbq chicken tenders and they were on the dry side, less than warm, and lacking flavour. fortunately, due to the superb quality of the rest of our meal it was easy to overlook this. thanks guys:",1,1,True,en-UK,Google
"Went to a screening of Anatomy of a Fall here. Screen 1 is so grand and beautiful! Chairs are comfortable, space is big. The lobby is gorgeous too. Honestly the whole building is stunning and worth at least one visit. Only complaint is that the walls are so SO thin. During the film screening I could hear cars honking and beeping and ambulance sirens from the main road. Honestly it took me a minute to realise that the noise was n't coming from the movie lol but when i did n't i could n't stop hearing it. It actually shocking how loud the sound were. Not sure why the main screen has n't been sound proofed, can only speculate that it may be because it a grade II listed building. Not really that big of a deal though if you not an audiophile and also if you going to watch a loud marvel type blockbuster haha.",1,1,True,en-UK,Google
"Ordered a burrito, burger meal, pitta bread and hummus. Half an hour late so rang up and said ' if you ordered from Donny eats there no order ' I wanted to know how he knew I ordered from Donny eats if the order did n't actually exist hmmm  he could n't answer. He then said driver was two mins away. Driver turned up with lukewarm food, minus the hummus, burger meal is terrible, but the burrito was nice I give them that.",0,0,True,en-UK,Google
Fantastic pub if you ever fancy a few beers in Islington and not have cash intravenously removed from your account. The curries are n't bad either.,1,1,True,en-UK,Google

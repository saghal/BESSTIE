"Looks cool, staff are fun and efficient, and most importantly the food was delicious. Had a ln early dinner of the tapas and fried chicken burger. Tapas had the best corn fritters I can remember, tasty salmon on fried wontons, meat balls with cumin( yum), and some sticky pork belly. Fried chicken burger had crunchy tenderloins and was good and tasty! Only advice would be to get those chips crunchier Coffee( I had two) chai, and iced chocolate were also of a high standard.

"Chicken recipes are nice and decent quality. They have a larger menu than the usual Broaster does, such as wingettes in different flavours. Chicken is definitely genuinely halal.

Other than those, I'm sure you will enjoy their chicken.",0,0,True,en-AU,Google
"Authentic Thai. Place was relatively clean and well presented. We ordered a variety of meals and they came out in a timely fashion. One thing I would have to pick on is their attention to detail, as we asked for a very mild curry but got a very hot curry instead.

"I really wanted to give this place higher rating, but unfortunately could n't find a good enough reason to. Starting with the positive, prices are super competitive, most dishes are under 16. However, moving to the negative, dishes are on the small side, my kids and wife( not big eaters) asked to stop at a bakery after our meal as they were hungry. We also felt quality of food could have been much better. A few examples:-The cinnamon toast was flooded with butter, we could n't finish it.-Poached eggs on the Benedict were over cooked( like hard boiled egg)-Dishes were all super basic in execution, an average home cook could have easily done a better job. To top it all, we set outside in area which was nice enough but swarming with flies. I reckon the restaurant can do much more to deal with that, it much more than small nuisance ",1,1,True,en-AU,Google
Tried this place because it came recommended by my parents. I enjoyed the Chicken 65 buriyani. The Chicken 65 was soo tasty. Everything was tasty it sure cleared my sinuses with the right amount of spices. I really liked the appetiser of the Puri filled tamarind chutney and yogurt. Soo good. Enjoyed saag paneer and did n't really have time goat curry as the buriyani was enough. I got that for my aunt. Loved the roti and naans even if a bit over priced. The food is definitely tasty and nice. However a bit pricey. I always think Indian food is pricey. But I could have ordered only 1 buriyani. I downloaded the app to get reward points and 5 off. My bill was still I did take all the leftovers home. Waiters were very nice and food came out fast. So sad there was n't tea left to order.,0,0,True,en-AU,Google

Kids had Margherita and Hawaiian, adults had a couple of the veggie pizza toppings. Thin and crispy style with not too much toppings and cheese, which is how we prefer our pizzas.

"The coffee is exceptional here. Like next level. Beautiful flavour, expertly made, and very nicely presented. It an all round winner that emphatically underscores the view that you can get great coffee in regional areas. Nice egg and bacon roll here. A generous size with a good amount of egg and bacon. The tomato relish was a little too sweet for me though and it was so liberally applied that it oozed out the side of the roll with the slightest pressure. The chicken and pesto roll thingy was a tiny bit disappointing for me-I found it a bit bland and over complicated-but not so for my partner who enjoyed it. It not cheap here but it all good quality. The cafe is small and it nicely and fashionably set out in the urban hipster style with some good tables on the street. It was doing a very brisk takeaway trade while we were here and plenty of people were on the outside tables too. The staff were young and friendly and doing a good job in an amiable way.

This place used to do amazing Afghan naan. But now the quality and weight of naan has dropped. Naan has got smaller and middle of the naan is like paper with burns. This business is not operating in an ethical way since they have two lines for naan. One line of one pack and another line for more than one pack. Which is ridiculous cos line for more than one pack gets stagnant while one pack line moves since they serve only that line. They need to adopt a number serving system soon I think.

The only con we had was the pillows, for such an incredibly soft bed we had soft pillows too, it would be better to have medium to hard pillows with such a bed. QT is situated in the centre of the CBD, a minute walk to shopping malls, galleries and theatres. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend to anyone travelling to Perth! Thank you again QT team for such a warm welcome! My partner and I will now go by Sparkle and Spunk",0,0,True,en-AU,Google
We had the feed me menu with paired wines and it was well worth the money. We dined here many times before and have never been disappointed with the food or wine pairings. The UB billtong was a highlight-soft and tasty. Only reason I rated at a 4 not a 5 was the service. The staff member looking after us was n't particularly interested in us unlike some of the other tables with more people on them. I would have liked to hear more about the wine pairings and the food as part of the experience. However it was a busy night for them so I understand.,0,0,True,en-AU,Google

"The food at this place is very good and filling. The prices are fair and the food was prepared efficiently, freshly in front of you. and the people have good manners. I give this place a 4 star rating and would recommend going and trying it out. The layout of the menu was a bit confusing though, and food presentation could be improved. Other than that, it's pretty good.",0,0,True,en-AU,Google

"It is a cozy restaurant that serves fusion Thai cuisine with local Aussie touch. We ordered crispy barramundi with apple salad, stir-fry basil mixed veggies and beef, and wonton soup. The serving portion was big for two persons, and the food was relatively good. The restaurant tables were n't fully seated, yet we waited almost 30 mins for our food to be served. Besides the waiting time, we felt relaxed with the waitresses good service.",0,0,True,en-AU,Google
"Welcomed by employees at information desk. They explained it's tiny building, fair enough. I do n't have to book from website( I do n't want to) and it's ok to visit * walk in. Surprise it's free of charge. 2nd floor mostly information about the Opera House. There is lift for easy access. Toilets are clean, it's important for me. Anyway, good enough to see around and spend time near Circular Quay area.",0,0,True,en-AU,Google
"Our visit to Belle Vue Cafe in Warwick was alright. The meal and service were okay, and the prices were reasonable. They have a decent selection of burger options, and the atmosphere is quite pleasant. We also ordered some coffee, salad, and pancakes, which did take a bit of time to arrive, but when they did, the satisfaction was there, so no complaints. They're famous for their scones, milkshakes, and sandwiches, so those might be worth a try. We did not spend much time in town, we searched for the good cafe & the place came first in list from map suggestions.",0,0,True,en-AU,Google
"The recent rennovation is exactly what this pub needed. It has a real country pub look to it now. Before it was very bland. Had a steak lunch and it was great, credit to the new chef. I hope they can keep it up. Best pub in Bowral and probably the highlands.",0,0,True,en-AU,Google

"Enjoyed a lovely diner at the Thai Classic Resturant tonight and boy was it a tasty treat. As a lover of thai food as many of us are, means i have a lot of meals to compare this to and for the most part it was great. Smaller issues was a mistake with our order and a little cramped for my liking. Will be going back for sure and would recommend to anyone that loves a good thai.",0,0,True,en-AU,Google
"We recently stayed at the Adina and I have to say we were thoroughly disappointed with the room we were allocated. The hotel was fully booked and I feel as though the room we were given should n't of been offered to guests. It smelled like dank, musty cigarette which we could still smell on our clothes in our suitcases when we got home, there was visible dust on the TV cabinet, and on the first night, our air conditioner did n't work. The next morning the Manager( who was quick to respond to our request) came up to our room to inspect and kicked the unit to get it working again. At least it worked. Not only was the hotel in bad shape, but the city too. There is a TAB just downstairs from the accommodation which attracts the wrong types of people. My son( age 7) dodged a bicycle being thrown in his direction from one of the TAB patrons who was yelling and swearing at another patron, they were about to get into a physical altercation. We crossed the road very quickly! We felt very unsafe. The city is housing many who are doing it tough and sleeping rough and on my morning walk, all I could smell was human urine. I wo n't be staying at this hotel or in the CBD for some time after this experience.",0,1,False,en-AU,Google
"Cold meal sml portions of chips even though l order large and they give you greasy food and do n't even supply napkins through drive thru anymore.

"This Korean barbecue restaurant holds sentimental value for me as it was the first place I dined out upon arriving in Brisbane several years ago. While I've noticed a slight decline in food quality since then, the experience is still worth revisiting. Despite its enduring popularity, the cleanliness of the establishment leaves something to be desired, with sticky floors and somewhat unclean restrooms. Nevertheless, the vibrant atmosphere and unique dining experience make it a worthwhile visit.",0,0,True,en-AU,Google
Why did I wait so long before checking this place out. It was fantastic. The building has been modernised as best as possible for accessibility and there are a few art stations where kids can have a break and contribute. It would be nice if there were more exhibitions and a bit of information about the history of some of the rooms would be helpful. Even a little something about the historical building itself.,0,0,True,en-AU,Google
"Good place to visit with kids, for swimming, diving, snorkeling and fishing. There is something to do for everyone. We visited on a sunday and the train was booked out for the next 2hours when we arrived. It's possible to walk on it but if you want to experience the train better Book in advance. The walk is about 20min one way. Better put sunscreen on and have a water bottle with you.",0,0,True,en-AU,Google
"This was the only place opened in Gladstone on the 2 January. Everywhere else dead, closed until 9-It looked like a ghost town. Do not recommend visiting Gladstone on a road trip around the Xmas and the New Year. I am glad that the Steak House was opened. It was full of guests Inside. Outside, it looked as dead as the rest of the town. It is a proper food place with a good beer selection and pub classics. We had fish and chips. Maybe a bit too greasy and the old oil used in the fryer, but edible. It was food.",0,1,False,en-AU,Google
"Loved this place. Their food is of authentic taste. This is the best asian food place I've visited in Ballarat. The fried rice and the tom yum soup are two perfections.

Beautiful sunny spot for a winter morning. Food was good and the welcome was very friendly. Closes at midday on Saturday and Sunday so no big sleep ins. Supporting flood victims by selling reclaimed wood items. Well worth a look.,0,0,True,en-AU,Google
"EDIT: I came here again soon after and it was so much better! I think it might have been that I left the noodles sealed in the bowl for too long before eating so they went a bit mushy. I highly recommend removing the lid as soon as you can. I remember really loving this place when I used to eat here regularly, but having recently eaten there for the first time in a while, I'm not that impressed. The flavours were great, but the texture could have been a bit better. I will be coming back. It might have just been an off night for them",0,0,True,en-AU,Google
Had a night out with a mate and his family and my family.. the bowling was great fun and having the automatic bumpers for the kids was great. For a Saturday night I feel they could have used an extra staff or so to man the bar. Had to go back to bowling a few time when waiting to order drinks.. prices were quite reasonable for 2 games. We will be back again soon. Update.. had a Boys night rocked up at 9 pm got on a lane for 2 games the staff were very helpful and great behind the bar. They gave us plenty of notice before the bar closed. Great night a great place to come for family entertainment!,0,0,True,en-AU,Google
"We ordered some rice plus few dishes for seven of us. We got rice first and had to wait another 40minutes for the other dishes which is unacceptable. By the time we received the other dishes rice was too cold and was not edible... when we asked staff members, said that they are too busy and can heat the rice up again. Not sure if I go there again.",0,1,False,en-AU,Google

Rating is mostly for the helpful and friendly staff! We were looking for a halal place to have a quick and easy dinner. The staff member let me know this place is 100 % halal so we grabbed two medium pizzas( I think the bill was about 32). Pizza was a little disappointing on flavour because despite being totally different pizzas they kind of tasted the same. I think they could use a little more sauce if I honest-we added our own at home. Overall we did n't have super high expectations for a kebab shop pizzas but had a good experience. We got the quick and easy dinner we were looking for,0,0,True,en-AU,Google

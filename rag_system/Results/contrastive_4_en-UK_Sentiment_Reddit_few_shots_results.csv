The plan itself, to send them to another country for processing isn't actually illegal so they should be able to find a safe country to do this.
Simply declaring Rwanda officially safe is insane, particularly as there are Rwandan refugees fleeing from Rwanda who have applied for asylum in the UK.
The Home office won't talk about this, but i suspect that the finances won't stand up for scrutiny and i suspect that the UK taxpayer has financed those Rwandan homes their government is currently selling off that Cruella Slaverman admired so much.
Rwanda is yet another black hole for taxpayer's money and the National Debt is about to hit 3 trillion. (3,000,000,000,000).

My mum wasn't a well woman, she had MS and was bed bound, had carers coming in to see her 4 times a day and after my dad passed in November the rest of the time it was just me to take care of her and I failed her.

I thought I was leaving her in good hands and I needed to help my brother in law with my nephews. Anyhoo 6 hours after being taken she was discharged. A subsequent conversation with the advanced nurse practitioner as my mum was found eating tissue paper I mentioned she had just been in hospital and this practitioner said she wouldn't have been discharged if there was anything wrong and asked me if I wanted her in hospital. I said I just wanted what was best for my mum.

"I'd be very surprised if I could say something that the other person doesn't already know but chooses to ignore or reinterpret. If the Israeli government officials can say things like they are to treat the Palestinians like'Amalek' while calling them human animals, and that they are going to turn Gaza into a wasteland while the IDF does exactly those things, you have to be insane or evil not to be against Israel. Why bother debating insane or evil people",0,0,True,en-UK,Reddit

"This was because parents were doing their normal shop and then offering the vouchers at the end once everything had been scanned. It was just a reminder because people forgot and it was causing problems. In no way was it put up because people went in with vouchers and spent it all on alcohol. 
In any case this was a covid measure and only lasted a year, so it's way old news. Meal vouchers to spend in supermarkets don't exist any more. 
This is daily mail level manipulation and anyone falling for it needs to give their head a wobble. OP has an agenda which is hateful and doesn't reflect reality at all. 
Quite a few schools pooled the meals vouchers and bought in bulk to make up food packages, so that parents got more stuff than they would have got individually. 
Personally I think it's disgraceful that schools are practically the only safety net that kids have regarding nutrition, domestic violence and mental health.",0,0,True,en-UK,Reddit
I think some people are missing the broader points here of course through our situations such as football matches where fans are separated and it makes sense there is a larger issue here The larger issue is that these protests are portrayed as pure pro Palestinian peace protests and if that were true there would be no issue with someone who is openly Jewish walking amongst these protesters but the moment we see someone who is Jewish is targeted because they are Jewish it exposes the real agenda of some of the protesters and therefore and that is the issue here.,0,0,True,en-UK,Reddit
